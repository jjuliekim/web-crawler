# Crawling, Merging, Vertical Search

## Objective
You will write a web crawler, and crawl Internet documents to construct a document collection focused on a particular topic. Your crawler must conform strictly to a particular politeness policy. Once the documents are crawled, you will pool them together using elasticsearch. Your crawler will manage a frontier of URLs to be crawled. The frontier will initially contain just your seed URLs. URLs will be added to the frontier as you crawl, by finding the links on the web pages you crawl.

1. Task 1 - Crawler
2. Task 2 - Link Graph
3. Task 3 - Merging team indexes
