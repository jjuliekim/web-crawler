    "content": "In common usage climate change describes global warmingthe ongoing increase in global average temperatureand its effects on Earths climate system Climate change in a broader sense also includes previous long-term changes to Earths climate The current rise in global average temperature is more rapid than previous changes and is primarily caused by humans burning fossil fuels34 Fossil fuel use deforestation and some agricultural and industrial practices add to greenhouse gases notably carbon dioxide and methane5 Greenhouse gases absorb some of the heat that the Earth radiates after it warms from sunlight Larger amounts of these gases trap more heat in Earths lower atmosphere causing global warming\nClimate change has an increasingly large impact on the environment Deserts are expanding while heat waves and wildfires are becoming more common6 Amplified warming in the Arctic has contributed to thawing permafrost retreat of glaciers and sea ice decline7 Higher temperatures are also causing more intense storms droughts and other weather extremes8 Rapid environmental change in mountains coral reefs and the Arctic is forcing many species to relocate or become extinct9 Even if efforts to minimise future warming are successful some effects will continue for centuries These include ocean heating ocean acidification and sea level rise10\nClimate change threatens people with increased flooding extreme heat increased food and water scarcity more disease and economic loss Human migration and conflict can also be a result11 The World Health Organization WHO calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century12 Societies and ecosystems will experience more severe risks without action to limit warming13 Adapting to climate change through efforts like flood control measures or drought-resistant crops partially reduces climate change risks although some limits to adaptation have already been reached14 Poorer communities are responsible for a small share of global emissions yet have the least ability to adapt and are most vulnerable to climate change1516\nMany climate change impacts have been felt in recent years with 2023 the warmest on record at 148\u00a0C 266\u00a0F18 Additional warming will increase these impacts and can trigger tipping points such as melting all of the Greenland ice sheet19 Under the 2015 Paris Agreement nations collectively agreed to keep warming well under 2\u00a0C However with pledges made under the Agreement global warming would still reach about 27\u00a0C 49\u00a0F by the end of the century20 Limiting warming to 15\u00a0C will require halving emissions by 2030 and achieving net-zero emissions by 205021\nStrategies to phase out fossil fuels involve conserving energy generating clean and sustainable electricity and using electricity to power transportation heat buildings and operate industrial facilities The electricity supply can be made cleaner and more plentiful by vastly increasing the deployment of wind and solar power alongside other forms of renewable energy and nuclear power2223 Carbon can also be removed from the atmosphere for instance by increasing forest cover and farming with methods that capture carbon in soil24\nBefore the 1980s it was unclear whether the warming effect of increased greenhouse gases was stronger than the cooling effect of airborne particulates in air pollution Scientists used the term inadvertent climate modification to refer to human impacts on the climate at this time25\nIn the 1980s the terms global warming and climate change became more common often being used interchangeably26 Scientifically global warming refers only to increased surface warming while climate change describes both global warming and its effects on Earths climate system such as precipitation changes25 Climate change can also be used more broadly to include changes to the climate that have happened throughout Earths history27 Global warmingused as early as 197528became the more popular term after NASA climate scientist James Hansen used it in his 1988 testimony in the US Senate29 Since the 2000s climate change has increased usage30\nVarious scientists politicians and media now use the terms climate crisis or climate emergency to talk about climate change and global heating instead of global warming31\nPrior to human evolution the record includes hotter temperatures and occasional abrupt changes such as the PaleoceneEocene Thermal Maximum 555 million years ago34\nOver the last few million years Human beings evolved in a climate that cycled through ice ages with global average temperature ranging between current levels and 56\u00a0C colder than today3536 \nHistorical patterns of warming and cooling like the Medieval Warm Period and the Little Ice Age did not occur at the same time across different regions Temperatures may have reached as high as those of the late 20th century in a limited set of regions37 Climate information for that period comes from climate proxies such as trees and ice cores38\nAround 1850 thermometer records began to provide global coverage41 \nBetween the 18th century and 1970 there was little net warming as the warming impact of greenhouse gas emissions was offset by cooling from sulfur dioxide emissions Sulfur dioxide causes acid rain but it also produces sulfate aerosols in the atmosphere which reflect sunlight and cause so-called global dimming After 1970 the increasing accumulation of greenhouse gases and controls on sulfur pollution led to a marked increase in temperature424344\nMultiple independent datasets all show worldwide increases in surface temperature45 at a rate of around 02\u00a0C per decade46 The 2013-2022 decade warmed to an average 115\u00a0C 100125\u00a0C compared to the pre-industrial baseline 1850190047 Not every single year was warmer than the last internal climate variability processes can make any year 02\u00a0C warmer or colder than the average48 From 1998 to 2013 negative phases of two such processes Pacific Decadal Oscillation PDO49 and Atlantic Multidecadal Oscillation AMO50 caused a so-called global warming hiatus51 After the hiatus the opposite occurred with years like 2023 exhibiting temperatures well above even the recent average52 This is why the temperature change is defined in terms of a 20-year average which minimises the noise of hot and cold years and decadal climate patterns and detects the long-term signal53\u200a5\u200a54\nA wide range of other observations reinforce the evidence of warming5556 The upper atmosphere is cooling because greenhouse gases are trapping heat near the Earths surface and so less heat is radiating into space57 Warming reduces average snow cover and forces the retreat of glaciers At the same time warming also causes greater evaporation from the oceans leading to more atmospheric humidity more and heavier precipitation58 Plants are flowering earlier in spring and thousands of animal species have been permanently moving to cooler areas59\nDifferent regions of the world warm at different rates The pattern is independent of where greenhouse gases are emitted because the gases persist long enough to diffuse across the planet Since the pre-industrial period the average surface temperature over land regions has increased almost twice as fast as the global-average surface temperature60 This is because oceans lose more heat by evaporation and oceans can store a lot of heat61 The thermal energy in the global climate system has grown with only brief pauses since at least 1970 and over 90 of this extra energy has been stored in the ocean6263 The rest has heated the atmosphere melted ice and warmed the continents64\nThe Northern Hemisphere and the North Pole have warmed much faster than the South Pole and Southern Hemisphere The Northern Hemisphere not only has much more land but also more seasonal snow cover and sea ice As these surfaces flip from reflecting a lot of light to being dark after the ice has melted they start absorbing more heat65 Local black carbon deposits on snow and ice also contribute to Arctic warming66 Arctic surface temperatures are increasing between three and four times faster than in the rest of the world676869 Melting of ice sheets near the poles weakens both the Atlantic and the Antarctic limb of thermohaline circulation which further changes the distribution of heat and precipitation around the globe70717273\nThe World Meteorological Organization estimates a 66 chance of global temperatures exceeding 15\u00a0C warming from the preindustrial baseline for at least one year between 2023 and 20277677 Because the IPCC uses a 20 year average to define global temperature changes a single year exceeding 15\u00a0C does not break the limit\nThe IPCC expects the 20-year average global temperature to exceed 15\u00a0C in the early 2030s78 The IPCC Sixth Assessment Report 2023 included projections that by 2100 global warming is very likely to reach 10-18\u00a0C under a scenario with very low emissions of greenhouse gases 21-35\u00a0C under an intermediate emissions scenario \nor 33-57\u00a0C under a very high emissions scenario79 In the intermediate and high emission scenarios the warming will continue past 21008081\nThe remaining carbon budget for staying beneath certain temperature increases is determined by modelling the carbon cycle and climate sensitivity to greenhouse gases82 According to the IPCC global warming can be kept below 15\u00a0C with a two-thirds chance if emissions after 2018 do not exceed 420 or 570 gigatonnes of CO2 This corresponds to 10 to 13 years of current emissions  There are high uncertainties about the budget For instance it may be 100 gigatonnes of CO2 equivalent smaller due to CO2 and methane release from permafrost and wetlands83 However it is clear that fossil fuel resources need to be proactively kept in the ground to prevent substantial warming Otherwise their shortages would not occur until the emissions have already locked in significant long-term impacts84\nThe climate system experiences various cycles on its own which can last for years decades or even centuries For example El Ni\u00f1o events cause short-term spikes in surface temperature while La Ni\u00f1a events cause short term cooling85 Their relative frequency can affect global temperature trends on a decadal timescale86 Other changes are caused by an imbalance of energy from external forcings87 Examples of these include changes in the concentrations of greenhouse gases solar luminosity volcanic eruptions and variations in the Earths orbit around the Sun88\nTo determine the human contribution to climate change unique fingerprints for all potential causes are developed and compared with both observed patterns and known internal climate variability89 For example solar forcingwhose fingerprint involves warming the entire atmosphereis ruled out because only the lower atmosphere has warmed90 Atmospheric aerosols produce a smaller cooling effect Other drivers such as changes in albedo are less impactful91\nGreenhouse gases are transparent to sunlight and thus allow it to pass through the atmosphere to heat the Earths surface The Earth radiates it as heat and greenhouse gases absorb a portion of it This absorption slows the rate at which heat escapes into space trapping heat near the Earths surface and warming it over time97\nWhile water vapour 50 and clouds 25 are the biggest contributors to the greenhouse effect they primarily change as a function of temperature and are therefore mostly considered to be feedbacks that change climate sensitivity On the other hand concentrations of gases such as CO2 20 tropospheric ozone98 CFCs and nitrous oxide are added or removed independently from temperature and are therefore considered to be external forcings that change global temperatures99\nBefore the Industrial Revolution naturally-occurring amounts of greenhouse gases caused the air near the surface to be about 33\u00a0C warmer than it would have been in their absence100101 Human activity since the Industrial Revolution mainly extracting and burning fossil fuels coal oil and natural gas102 has increased the amount of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere resulting in a radiative imbalance In 2019 the concentrations of CO2 and methane had increased by about 48 and 160 respectively since 1750103 These CO2 levels are higher than they have been at any time during the last 2 million years Concentrations of methane are far higher than they were over the last 800000 years104\nGlobal anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions in 2019 were equivalent to 59\u00a0billion tonnes of CO2 Of these emissions 75 was CO2 18 was methane 4 was nitrous oxide and 2 was fluorinated gases105 CO2 emissions primarily come from burning fossil fuels to provide energy for transport manufacturing heating and electricity5 Additional CO2 emissions come from deforestation and industrial processes which include the CO2 released by the chemical reactions for making cement steel aluminum and fertiliser106 Methane emissions come from livestock manure rice cultivation landfills wastewater and coal mining as well as oil and gas extraction107 Nitrous oxide emissions largely come from the microbial decomposition of fertiliser108\nWhile methane only lasts in the atmosphere for an average of 12 years109 CO2 lasts much longer The Earths surface absorbs CO2 as part of the carbon cycle While plants on land and in the ocean absorb most excess emissions of CO2 every year that CO2 is returned back to the atmosphere when biological matter is digested burns or decays110 Land-surface carbon sink processes such as carbon fixation in the soil and photosynthesis remove about 29 of annual global CO2 emissions111 The ocean has absorbed 20 to 30 of emitted CO2 over the last 2 decades112 CO2 is only removed from the atmosphere for the long term when it is stored in the Earths crust which is a process that can take millions of years to complete110\nAccording to Food and Agriculture Organization around 30 of Earths land area is largely unusable for humans glaciers deserts etc 26 is forests 10 is shrubland and 34 is agricultural land114 Deforestation is the main land use change contributor to global warming115 as the destroyed trees release CO2 and are not replaced by new trees removing that carbon sink24 Between 2001 and 2018 27 of deforestation was from permanent clearing to enable agricultural expansion for crops and livestock Another 24 has been lost to temporary clearing under the shifting cultivation agricultural systems 26 was due to logging for wood and derived products and wildfires have accounted for the remaining 23116 Some forests have not been fully cleared but were already degraded by these impacts Restoring these forests also recovers their potential as a carbon sink117\nLocal vegetation cover impacts how much of the sunlight gets reflected back into space albedo and how much heat is lost by evaporation For instance the change from a dark forest to grassland makes the surface lighter causing it to reflect more sunlight Deforestation can also modify the release of chemical compounds that influence clouds and by changing wind patterns118 In tropic and temperate areas the net effect is to produce significant warming and forest restoration can make local temperatures cooler117 At latitudes closer to the poles there is a cooling effect as forest is replaced by snow-covered and more reflective plains118 Globally these increases in surface albedo have been the dominant direct influence on temperature from land use change Thus land use change to date is estimated to have a slight cooling effect119\nAir pollution in the form of aerosols affects the climate on a large scale120 Aerosols scatter and absorb solar radiation From 1961 to 1990 a gradual reduction in the amount of sunlight reaching the Earths surface was observed This phenomenon is popularly known as global dimming121 and is primarily attributed to sulfate aerosols produced by the combustion of fossil fuels with heavy sulfur concentrations like coal and bunker fuel44 Smaller contributions come from black carbon organic carbon from combustion of fossil fuels and biofuels and from anthropogenic dust12243123124125 Globally aerosols have been declining since 1990 due to pollution controls meaning that they no longer mask greenhouse gas warming as much12644\nAerosols also have indirect effects on the Earths energy budget Sulfate aerosols act as cloud condensation nuclei and lead to clouds that have more and smaller cloud droplets These clouds reflect solar radiation more efficiently than clouds with fewer and larger droplets127 They also reduce the growth of raindrops which makes clouds more reflective to incoming sunlight128 Indirect effects of aerosols are the largest uncertainty in radiative forcing129\nWhile aerosols typically limit global warming by reflecting sunlight black carbon in soot that falls on snow or ice can contribute to global warming Not only does this increase the absorption of sunlight it also increases melting and sea-level rise130 Limiting new black carbon deposits in the Arctic could reduce global warming by 02\u00a0C by 2050131 The effect of decreasing sulfur content of fuel oil for ships since 2020132 is estimated to cause an additional 005\u00a0C increase in global mean temperature by 2050133\nAs the Sun is the Earths primary energy source changes in incoming sunlight directly affect the climate system129 Solar irradiance has been measured directly by satellites136 and indirect measurements are available from the early 1600s onwards129 Since 1880 there has been no upward trend in the amount of the Suns energy reaching the Earth in contrast to the warming of the lower atmosphere the troposphere137 The upper atmosphere the stratosphere would also be warming if the Sun was sending more energy to Earth but instead it has been cooling90 \nThis is consistent with greenhouse gases preventing heat from leaving the Earths atmosphere138\nExplosive volcanic eruptions can release gases dust and ash that partially block sunlight and reduce temperatures or they can send water vapor into the atmosphere which adds to greenhouse gases and increases temperatures139 These impacts on temperature only last for several years because both water vapor and volcanic material have low persistence in the atmosphere140 volcanic CO2 emissions are more persistent but they are equivalent to less than 1 of current human-caused CO2 emissions141 Volcanic activity still represents the single largest natural impact forcing on temperature in the industrial era Yet like the other natural forcings it has had negligible impacts on global temperature trends since the Industrial Revolution142\nThe response of the climate system to an initial forcing is modified by feedbacks increased by self-reinforcing or positive feedbacks and reduced by balancing or negative feedbacks144 The main reinforcing feedbacks are the water-vapour feedback the icealbedo feedback and the net effect of clouds145146 The primary balancing mechanism is radiative cooling as Earths surface gives off more heat to space in response to rising temperature147 In addition to temperature feedbacks there are feedbacks in the carbon cycle such as the fertilising effect of CO2 on plant growth148\nUncertainty over feedbacks particularly cloud cover149 is the major reason why different climate models project different magnitudes of warming for a given amount of emissions150 As air warms it can hold more moisture Water vapour as a potent greenhouse gas holds heat in the atmosphere145 If cloud cover increases more sunlight will be reflected back into space cooling the planet If clouds become higher and thinner they act as an insulator reflecting heat from below back downwards and warming the planet151\nAnother major feedback is the reduction of snow cover and sea ice in the Arctic which reduces the reflectivity of the Earths surface152\nMore of the Suns energy is now absorbed in these regions contributing to amplification of Arctic temperature changes153 Arctic amplification is also thawing permafrost which releases methane and CO2 into the atmosphere154 Climate change can also cause methane releases from wetlands marine systems and freshwater systems155 Overall climate feedbacks are expected to become increasingly positive156\nAround half of human-caused CO2 emissions have been absorbed by land plants and by the oceans157 This fraction is not static and if future CO2 emissions decrease the Earth will be able to absorb up to around 70 If they increase substantially itll still absorb more carbon than now but the overall fraction will decrease to below 40158 This is because climate change increases droughts and heat waves that eventually inhibit plant growth on land and soils will release more carbon from dead plants when they are warmer159160 The rate at which oceans absorb atmospheric carbon will be lowered as they become more acidic and experience changes in thermohaline circulation and phytoplankton distribution16116271\nA climate model is a representation of the physical chemical and biological processes that affect the climate system163 Models include natural processes like changes in the Earths orbit historical changes in the Suns activity and volcanic forcing164 Models are used to estimate the degree of warming future emissions will cause when accounting for the strength of climate feedbacks165166 Models also predict the circulation of the oceans the annual cycle of the seasons and the flows of carbon between the land surface and the atmosphere167\nThe physical realism of models is tested by examining their ability to simulate contemporary or past climates168 Past models have underestimated the rate of Arctic shrinkage169 and underestimated the rate of precipitation increase170 Sea level rise since 1990 was underestimated in older models but more recent models agree well with observations171 The 2017 United States-published National Climate Assessment notes that climate models may still be underestimating or missing relevant feedback processes172 Additionally climate models may be unable to adequately predict short-term regional climatic shifts173\nA subset of climate models add societal factors to a physical climate model These models simulate how population economic growth and energy use affectand interact withthe physical climate With this information these models can produce scenarios of future greenhouse gas emissions This is then used as input for physical climate models and carbon cycle models to predict how atmospheric concentrations of greenhouse gases might change174175 Depending on the socioeconomic scenario and the mitigation scenario models produce atmospheric CO2 concentrations that range widely between 380 and 1400 ppm176\nThe environmental effects of climate change are broad and far-reaching affecting oceans ice and weather Changes may occur gradually or rapidly Evidence for these effects comes from studying climate change in the past from modelling and from modern observations177 Since the 1950s droughts and heat waves have appeared simultaneously with increasing frequency178 Extremely wet or dry events within the monsoon period have increased in India and East Asia179 Monsoonal precipitation over the Northern Hemisphere has increased since 1980180 The rainfall rate and intensity of hurricanes and typhoons is likely increasing181 and the geographic range likely expanding poleward in response to climate warming182 Frequency of tropical cyclones has not increased as a result of climate change183\nGlobal sea level is rising as a consequence of thermal expansion and the melting of glaciers and ice sheets Between 1993 and 2020 the rise increased over time averaging 33\u00a0\u00a003\u00a0mm per year185 Over the 21st century the IPCC projects 3262\u00a0cm of sea level rise under a low emission scenario 4476\u00a0cm under an intermediate one and 65101\u00a0cm under a very high emission scenario186 Marine ice sheet instability processes in Antarctica may add substantially to these values187 including the possibility of a 2-meter sea level rise by 2100 under high emissions188\nClimate change has led to decades of shrinking and thinning of the Arctic sea ice189 While ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 15\u00a0C degrees of warming they are set to occur once every three to ten years at a warming level of 2\u00a0C190 Higher atmospheric CO2 concentrations cause more CO2 to dissolve in the oceans which is making them more acidic191 Because oxygen is less soluble in warmer water192 its concentrations in the ocean are decreasing and dead zones are expanding193\nGreater degrees of global warming increase the risk of passing through tipping pointsthresholds beyond which certain major impacts can no longer be avoided even if temperatures return to their previous state196197 For instance the Greenland ice sheet is already melting but if global warming reaches levels between 17\u00a0C and 23\u00a0C its melting will continue until it fully disappears If the warming is later reduced to 15\u00a0C or less it will still lose a lot more ice than if the warming was never allowed to reach the threshold in the first place198 While the ice sheets would melt over millennia other tipping points would occur faster and give societies less time to respond The collapse of major ocean currents like the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation AMOC and irreversible damage to key ecosystems like the Amazon rainforest and coral reefs can unfold in a matter of decades195\nThe long-term effects of climate change on oceans include further ice melt ocean warming sea level rise ocean acidification and ocean deoxygenation199 The timescale of long term impacts are centuries to millennia due to CO2s long atmospheric lifetime200 When net emissions stabilise surface air temperatures will also stabilise but oceans and ice caps will continue to absorb excess heat from the atmosphere The result is an estimated total sea level rise of 23 metres per degree Celsius 42\u00a0ftF after 2000 years201 Oceanic CO2 uptake is slow enough that ocean acidification will also continue for hundreds to thousands of years202 Deep oceans below 2000 metres 6600\u00a0ft are also already committed to losing over 10 of their dissolved oxygen by the warming which occurred to date203 Further West Antarctic ice sheet appears committed to practically irreversible melting which would increase the sea levels by at least 33\u00a0m 10\u00a0ft 10\u00a0in over approximately 2000 years195204205206207208209210\nRecent warming has driven many terrestrial and freshwater species poleward and towards higher altitudes211 Higher atmospheric CO2 levels and an extended growing season have resulted in global greening However heatwaves and drought have reduced ecosystem productivity in some regions The future balance of these opposing effects is unclear212 Climate change has contributed to the expansion of drier climate zones such as the expansion of deserts in the subtropics213 The size and speed of global warming is making abrupt changes in ecosystems more likely214 Overall it is expected that climate change will result in the extinction of many species215\nThe oceans have heated more slowly than the land but plants and animals in the ocean have migrated towards the colder poles faster than species on land216 Just as on land heat waves in the ocean occur more frequently due to climate change harming a wide range of organisms such as corals kelp and seabirds217 Ocean acidification makes it harder for marine calcifying organisms such as mussels barnacles and corals to produce shells and skeletons and heatwaves have bleached coral reefs218 Harmful algal blooms enhanced by climate change and eutrophication lower oxygen levels disrupt food webs and cause great loss of marine life219 Coastal ecosystems are under particular stress Almost half of global wetlands have disappeared due to climate change and other human impacts220\nThe effects of climate change are impacting humans everywhere in the world226 Impacts can be observed on all continents and ocean regions227 with low-latitude less developed areas facing the greatest risk228 Continued warming has potentially severe pervasive and irreversible impacts for people and ecosystems229 The risks are unevenly distributed but are generally greater for disadvantaged people in developing and developed countries230\nThe World Health Organization WHO calls climate change the greatest threat to global health in the 21st century231 Extreme weather leads to injury and loss of life232 Various infectious diseases are more easily transmitted in a warmer climate such as dengue fever and malaria233 Crop failures can lead to food shortages and malnutrition particularly effecting children234 Both children and older people are vulnerable to extreme heat235 The WHO has estimated that between 2030 and 2050 climate change would cause around 250000 additional deaths per year They assessed deaths from heat exposure in elderly people increases in diarrhea malaria dengue coastal flooding and childhood malnutrition236 By 2100 50 to 75 of the global population may face climate conditions that are life-threatening due to combined effects of extreme heat and humidity237\nClimate change is affecting food security It has caused reduction in global yields of maize wheat and soybeans between 1981 and 2010238 Future warming could further reduce global yields of major crops239 Crop production will probably be negatively affected in low-latitude countries while effects at northern latitudes may be positive or negative240 Up to an additional 183 million people worldwide particularly those with lower incomes are at risk of hunger as a consequence of these impacts241 Climate change also impacts fish populations Globally less will be available to be fished242 Regions dependent on glacier water regions that are already dry and small islands have a higher risk of water stress due to climate change243\nEconomic damages due to climate change may be severe and there is a chance of disastrous consequences244 Severe impacts are expected in South-East Asia and sub-Saharan Africa where most of the local inhabitants are dependent upon natural and agricultural resources245246 Heat stress can prevent outdoor labourers from working If warming reaches 4\u00a0C then labour capacity in those regions could be reduced by 30 to 50247 The World Bank estimates that between 2016 and 2030 climate change could drive over 120 million people into extreme poverty without adaptation248\nInequalities based on wealth and social status have worsened due to climate change249 Major difficulties in mitigating adapting and recovering to climate shocks are faced by marginalised people who have less control over resources250245 Indigenous people who are subsistent on their land and ecosystems will face endangerment to their wellness and lifestyles due to climate change251 An expert elicitation concluded that the role of climate change in armed conflict has been small compared to factors such as socio-economic inequality and state capabilities252\nWhile women are not inherently more at risk from climate change and shocks limits on womens resources and discriminatory gender norms constrain their adaptive capacity and resilience253 For example womens work burdens including hours worked in agriculture tend to decline less than mens during climate shocks such as heat stress253\nLow-lying islands and coastal communities are threatened by sea level rise which makes urban flooding more common Sometimes land is permanently lost to the sea254 This could lead to statelessness for people in island nations such as the Maldives and Tuvalu255 In some regions the rise in temperature and humidity may be too severe for humans to adapt to256 With worst-case climate change models project that almost one-third of humanity might live in Sahara-like uninhabitable and extremely hot climates257\nThese factors can drive climate or environmental migration within and between countries11 More people are expected to be displaced because of sea level rise extreme weather and conflict from increased competition over natural resources Climate change may also increase vulnerability leading to trapped populations who are not able to move due to a lack of resources258\nClimate change can be mitigated by reducing the rate at which greenhouse gases are emitted into the atmosphere and by increasing the rate at which carbon dioxide is removed from the atmosphere264 In order to limit global warming to less than 15\u00a0C global greenhouse gas emissions needs to be net-zero by 2050 or by 2070 with a 2\u00a0C target83 This requires far-reaching systemic changes on an unprecedented scale in energy land cities transport buildings and industry265\nThe United Nations Environment Programme estimates that countries need to triple their pledges under the Paris Agreement within the next decade to limit global warming to 2\u00a0C An even greater level of reduction is required to meet the 15\u00a0C goal266 With pledges made under the Paris Agreement as of October 2021 global warming would still have a 66 chance of reaching about 27\u00a0C range 2232\u00a0C by the end of the century20 Globally limiting warming to 2\u00a0C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs267\nAlthough there is no single pathway to limit global warming to 15 or 2\u00a0C268 most scenarios and strategies see a major increase in the use of renewable energy in combination with increased energy efficiency measures to generate the needed greenhouse gas reductions269 To reduce pressures on ecosystems and enhance their carbon sequestration capabilities changes would also be necessary in agriculture and forestry270 such as preventing deforestation and restoring natural ecosystems by reforestation271\nOther approaches to mitigating climate change have a higher level of risk Scenarios that limit global warming to 15\u00a0C typically project the large-scale use of carbon dioxide removal methods over the 21st century272 There are concerns though about over-reliance on these technologies and environmental impacts273 Solar radiation modification SRM is also a possible supplement to deep reductions in emissions However SRM raises significant ethical and legal concerns and the risks are imperfectly understood274\nRenewable energy is key to limiting climate change276 For decades fossil fuels have accounted for roughly 80 of the worlds energy use277 The remaining share has been split between nuclear power and renewables including hydropower bioenergy wind and solar power and geothermal energy278 Fossil fuel use is expected to peak in absolute terms prior to 2030 and then to decline with coal use experiencing the sharpest reductions279 Renewables represented 75 of all new electricity generation installed in 2019 nearly all solar and wind280 Other forms of clean energy such as nuclear and hydropower currently have a larger share of the energy supply However their future growth forecasts appear limited in comparison281\nWhile solar panels and onshore wind are now among the cheapest forms of adding new power generation capacity in many locations282 green energy policies are needed to achieve a rapid transition from fossil fuels to renewables283 To achieve carbon neutrality by 2050 renewable energy would become the dominant form of electricity generation rising to 85 or more by 2050 in some scenarios Investment in coal would be eliminated and coal use nearly phased out by 2050284285\nElectricity generated from renewable sources would also need to become the main energy source for heating and transport286 Transport can switch away from internal combustion engine vehicles and towards electric vehicles public transit and active transport cycling and walking287288 For shipping and flying low-carbon fuels would reduce emissions287 Heating could be increasingly decarbonised with technologies like heat pumps289\nThere are obstacles to the continued rapid growth of clean energy including renewables For wind and solar there are environmental and land use concerns for new projects290 Wind and solar also produce energy intermittently and with seasonal variability Traditionally hydro dams with reservoirs and conventional power plants have been used when variable energy production is low Going forward battery storage can be expanded energy demand and supply can be matched and long-distance transmission can smooth variability of renewable outputs276 Bioenergy is often not carbon-neutral and may have negative consequences for food security291 The growth of nuclear power is constrained by controversy around radioactive waste nuclear weapon proliferation and accidents292293 Hydropower growth is limited by the fact that the best sites have been developed and new projects are confronting increased social and environmental concerns294\nLow-carbon energy improves human health by minimising climate change as well as reducing air pollution deaths295 which were estimated at 7 million annually in 2016296 Meeting the Paris Agreement goals that limit warming to a 2\u00a0C increase could save about a million of those lives per year by 2050 whereas limiting global warming to 15\u00a0C could save millions and simultaneously increase energy security and reduce poverty297 Improving air quality also has economic benefits which may be larger than mitigation costs298\nReducing energy demand is another major aspect of reducing emissions299 If less energy is needed there is more flexibility for clean energy development It also makes it easier to manage the electricity grid and minimises carbon-intensive infrastructure development300 Major increases in energy efficiency investment will be required to achieve climate goals comparable to the level of investment in renewable energy301 Several COVID-19 related changes in energy use patterns energy efficiency investments and funding have made forecasts for this decade more difficult and uncertain302\nStrategies to reduce energy demand vary by sector In the transport sector passengers and freight can switch to more efficient travel modes such as buses and trains or use electric vehicles303 Industrial strategies to reduce energy demand include improving heating systems and motors designing less energy-intensive products and increasing product lifetimes304 In the building sector the focus is on better design of new buildings and higher levels of energy efficiency in retrofitting305 The use of technologies like heat pumps can also increase building energy efficiency306\nAgriculture and forestry face a triple challenge of limiting greenhouse gas emissions preventing the further conversion of forests to agricultural land and meeting increases in world food demand307 A set of actions could reduce agriculture and forestry-based emissions by two thirds from 2010 levels These include reducing growth in demand for food and other agricultural products increasing land productivity protecting and restoring forests and reducing greenhouse gas emissions from agricultural production308\nOn the demand side a key component of reducing emissions is shifting people towards plant-based diets309 Eliminating the production of livestock for meat and dairy would eliminate about 34ths of all emissions from agriculture and other land use310 Livestock also occupy 37 of ice-free land area on Earth and consume feed from the 12 of land area used for crops driving deforestation and land degradation311\nSteel and cement production are responsible for about 13 of industrial CO2 emissions In these industries carbon-intensive materials such as coke and lime play an integral role in the production so that reducing CO2 emissions requires research into alternative chemistries312\nNatural carbon sinks can be enhanced to sequester significantly larger amounts of CO2 beyond naturally occurring levels313 Reforestation and afforestation planting forests where there were none before are among the most mature sequestration techniques although the latter raises food security concerns314 Farmers can promote sequestration of carbon in soils through practices such as use of winter cover crops reducing the intensity and frequency of tillage and using compost and manure as soil amendments315 Forest and landscape restoration yields many benefits for the climate including greenhouse gas emissions sequestration and reduction117 Restorationrecreation of coastal wetlands prairie plots and seagrass meadows increases the uptake of carbon into organic matter316317 When carbon is sequestered in soils and in organic matter such as trees there is a risk of the carbon being re-released into the atmosphere later through changes in land use fire or other changes in ecosystems318\nWhere energy production or CO2-intensive heavy industries continue to produce waste CO2 the gas can be captured and stored instead of released to the atmosphere Although its current use is limited in scale and expensive319 carbon capture and storage CCS may be able to play a significant role in limiting CO2 emissions by mid-century320 This technique in combination with bioenergy BECCS can result in net negative emissions as CO2 is drawn from the atmosphere321 It remains highly uncertain whether carbon dioxide removal techniques will be able to play a large role in limiting warming to 15\u00a0C Policy decisions that rely on carbon dioxide removal increase the risk of global warming rising beyond international goals322\nAdaptation is the process of adjustment to current or expected changes in climate and its effects323\u200a5\u200a Without additional mitigation adaptation cannot avert the risk of severe widespread and irreversible impacts324 More severe climate change requires more transformative adaptation which can be prohibitively expensive325 The capacity and potential for humans to adapt is unevenly distributed across different regions and populations and developing countries generally have less326 The first two decades of the 21st century saw an increase in adaptive capacity in most low- and middle-income countries with improved access to basic sanitation and electricity but progress is slow Many countries have implemented adaptation policies However there is a considerable gap between necessary and available finance327\nAdaptation to sea level rise consists of avoiding at-risk areas learning to live with increased flooding and building flood controls If that fails managed retreat may be needed328 There are economic barriers for tackling dangerous heat impact Avoiding strenuous work or having air conditioning is not possible for everybody329 In agriculture adaptation options include a switch to more sustainable diets diversification erosion control and genetic improvements for increased tolerance to a changing climate330 Insurance allows for risk-sharing but is often difficult to get for people on lower incomes331 Education migration and early warning systems can reduce climate vulnerability332 Planting mangroves or encouraging other coastal vegetation can buffer storms333334\nEcosystems adapt to climate change a process that can be supported by human intervention By increasing connectivity between ecosystems species can migrate to more favourable climate conditions Species can also be introduced to areas acquiring a favorable climate Protection and restoration of natural and semi-natural areas helps build resilience making it easier for ecosystems to adapt Many of the actions that promote adaptation in ecosystems also help humans adapt via ecosystem-based adaptation For instance restoration of natural fire regimes makes catastrophic fires less likely and reduces human exposure Giving rivers more space allows for more water storage in the natural system reducing flood risk Restored forest acts as a carbon sink but planting trees in unsuitable regions can exacerbate climate impacts335\nThere are synergies but also trade-offs between adaptation and mitigation336 An example for synergy is increased food productivity which has large benefits for both adaptation and mitigation337 An example of a trade-off is that increased use of air conditioning allows people to better cope with heat but increases energy demand Another trade-off example is that more compact urban development may reduce emissions from transport and construction but may also increase the urban heat island effect exposing people to heat-related health risks338\nCountries that are most vulnerable to climate change have typically been responsible for a small share of global emissions This raises questions about justice and fairness339 Limiting global warming makes it much easier to achieve the UNs Sustainable Development Goals such as eradicating poverty and reducing inequalities The connection is recognised in Sustainable Development Goal 13 which is to take urgent action to combat climate change and its impacts340 The goals on food clean water and ecosystem protection have synergies with climate mitigation341\nThe geopolitics of climate change is complex It has often been framed as a free-rider problem in which all countries benefit from mitigation done by other countries but individual countries would lose from switching to a low-carbon economy themselves Sometimes mitigation also has localised benefits though For instance the benefits of a coal phase-out to public health and local environments exceed the costs in almost all regions342 Furthermore net importers of fossil fuels win economically from switching to clean energy causing net exporters to face stranded assets fossil fuels they cannot sell343\nA wide range of policies regulations and laws are being used to reduce emissions As of 2019 carbon pricing covers about 20 of global greenhouse gas emissions344 Carbon can be priced with carbon taxes and emissions trading systems345 Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached 319 billion in 2017 and 52 trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in346 Ending these can cause a 28 reduction in global carbon emissions and a 46 reduction in air pollution deaths347 Money saved on fossil subsidies could be used to support the transition to clean energy instead348 More direct methods to reduce greenhouse gases include vehicle efficiency standards renewable fuel standards and air pollution regulations on heavy industry349 Several countries require utilities to increase the share of renewables in power production350\nPolicy designed through the lens of climate justice tries to address human rights issues and social inequality According to proponents of climate justice the costs of climate adaptation should be paid by those most responsible for climate change while the beneficiaries of payments should be those suffering impacts One way this can be addressed in practice is to have wealthy nations pay poorer countries to adapt351\nOxfam found that in 2023 the wealthiest 10 of people were responsible for 50 of global emissions while the bottom 50 were responsible for just 8352 Production of emissions is another way to look at responsibility under that approach the top 21 fossil fuel companies would owe cumulative climate reparations of 54 trillion over the period 20252050353 To achieve a just transition people working in the fossil fuel sector would also need other jobs and their communities would need investments354\nNearly all countries in the world are parties to the 1994 United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change UNFCCC356 The goal of the UNFCCC is to prevent dangerous human interference with the climate system357 As stated in the convention this requires that greenhouse gas concentrations are stabilised in the atmosphere at a level where ecosystems can adapt naturally to climate change food production is not threatened and economic development can be sustained358 The UNFCCC does not itself restrict emissions but rather provides a framework for protocols that do Global emissions have risen since the UNFCCC was signed359 Its yearly conferences are the stage of global negotiations360\nThe 1997 Kyoto Protocol extended the UNFCCC and included legally binding commitments for most developed countries to limit their emissions361 During the negotiations the G77 representing developing countries pushed for a mandate requiring developed countries to take the lead in reducing their emissions362 since developed countries contributed most to the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere Per-capita emissions were also still relatively low in developing countries and developing countries would need to emit more to meet their development needs363\nThe 2009 Copenhagen Accord has been widely portrayed as disappointing because of its low goals and was rejected by poorer nations including the G77364 Associated parties aimed to limit the global temperature rise to below 2\u00a0C365 The Accord set the goal of sending 100 billion per year to developing countries for mitigation and adaptation by 2020 and proposed the founding of the Green Climate Fund366 As of 2020update only 833 billion were delivered Only in 2023 the target is expected to be achieved367\nIn 2015 all UN countries negotiated the Paris Agreement which aims to keep global warming well below 20\u00a0C and contains an aspirational goal of keeping warming under 15\u00a0C368 The agreement replaced the Kyoto Protocol Unlike Kyoto no binding emission targets were set in the Paris Agreement Instead a set of procedures was made binding Countries have to regularly set ever more ambitious goals and reevaluate these goals every five years369 The Paris Agreement restated that developing countries must be financially supported370 As of October 2021update 194 states and the European Union have signed the treaty and 191 states and the EU have ratified or acceded to the agreement371\nThe 1987 Montreal Protocol an international agreement to stop emitting ozone-depleting gases may have been more effective at curbing greenhouse gas emissions than the Kyoto Protocol specifically designed to do so372 The 2016 Kigali Amendment to the Montreal Protocol aims to reduce the emissions of hydrofluorocarbons a group of powerful greenhouse gases which served as a replacement for banned ozone-depleting gases This made the Montreal Protocol a stronger agreement against climate change373\nIn 2019 the United Kingdom parliament became the first national government to declare a climate emergency374 Other countries and jurisdictions followed suit375 That same year the European Parliament declared a climate and environmental emergency376 The European Commission presented its European Green Deal with the goal of making the EU carbon-neutral by 2050377 In 2021 the European Commission released its Fit for 55 legislation package which contains guidelines for the car industry all new cars on the European market must be zero-emission vehicles from 2035378\nMajor countries in Asia have made similar pledges South Korea and Japan have committed to become carbon-neutral by 2050 and China by 2060379 While India has strong incentives for renewables it also plans a significant expansion of coal in the country380 Vietnam is among very few coal-dependent fast-developing countries that pledged to phase out unabated coal power by the 2040s or as soon as possible thereafter381\nAs of 2021 based on information from 48 national climate plans which represent 40 of the parties to the Paris Agreement estimated total greenhouse gas emissions will be 05 lower compared to 2010 levels below the 45 or 25 reduction goals to limit global warming to 15\u00a0C or 2\u00a0C respectively382\nPublic debate about climate change has been strongly affected by climate change denial and misinformation which originated in the United States and has since spread to other countries particularly Canada and Australia Climate change denial has originated from fossil fuel companies industry groups conservative think tanks and contrarian scientists384 Like the tobacco industry the main strategy of these groups has been to manufacture doubt about climate-change related scientific data and results385 People who hold unwarranted doubt about climate change are called climate change skeptics although contrarians or deniers are more appropriate terms386\nThere are different variants of climate denial some deny that warming takes place at all some acknowledge warming but attribute it to natural influences and some minimise the negative impacts of climate change387 Manufacturing uncertainty about the science later developed into a manufactured controversy creating the belief that there is significant uncertainty about climate change within the scientific community in order to delay policy changes388 Strategies to promote these ideas include criticism of scientific institutions389 and questioning the motives of individual scientists387 An echo chamber of climate-denying blogs and media has further fomented misunderstanding of climate change390\nClimate change came to international public attention in the late 1980s394 Due to media coverage in the early 1990s people often confused climate change with other environmental issues like ozone depletion395 In popular culture the climate fiction movie The Day After Tomorrow 2004 and the Al Gore documentary An Inconvenient Truth 2006 focused on climate change394\nSignificant regional gender age and political differences exist in both public concern for and understanding of climate change More highly educated people and in some countries women and younger people were more likely to see climate change as a serious threat396 Partisan gaps also exist in many countries397 and countries with high CO2 emissions tend to be less concerned398 Views on causes of climate change vary widely between countries399 Concern has increased over time397 to the point where in 2021 a majority of citizens in many countries express a high level of worry about climate change or view it as a global emergency400 Higher levels of worry are associated with stronger public support for policies that address climate change401\nClimate protests demand that political leaders take action to prevent climate change They can take the form of public demonstrations fossil fuel divestment lawsuits and other activities402 Prominent demonstrations include the School Strike for Climate In this initiative young people across the globe have been protesting since 2018 by skipping school on Fridays inspired by Swedish teenager Greta Thunberg403 Mass civil disobedience actions by groups like Extinction Rebellion have protested by disrupting roads and public transport404\nLitigation is increasingly used as a tool to strengthen climate action from public institutions and companies Activists also initiate lawsuits which target governments and demand that they take ambitious action or enforce existing laws on climate change405 Lawsuits against fossil-fuel companies generally seek compensation for loss and damage406\nScientists in the 19th century such as Alexander von Humboldt began to foresee the effects of climate change408409410411 In the 1820s Joseph Fourier proposed the greenhouse effect to explain why Earths temperature was higher than the Suns energy alone could explain Earths atmosphere is transparent to sunlight so sunlight reaches the surface where it is converted to heat However the atmosphere is not transparent to heat radiating from the surface and captures some of that heat which in turn warms the planet412\nIn 1856 Eunice Newton Foote demonstrated that the warming effect of the Sun is greater for air with water vapour than for dry air and that the effect is even greater with carbon dioxide CO2 She concluded that An atmosphere of that gas would give to our earth a high temperature413414\nStarting in 1859415 John Tyndall established that nitrogen and oxygentogether totaling 99 of dry airare transparent to radiated heat However water vapour and gases such as methane and carbon dioxide absorb radiated heat and re-radiate that heat into the atmosphere Tyndall proposed that changes in the concentrations of these gases may have caused climatic changes in the past including ice ages416\nSvante Arrhenius noted that water vapour in air continuously varied but the CO2 concentration in air was influenced by long-term geological processes Warming from increased CO2 levels would increase the amount of water vapour amplifying warming in a positive feedback loop In 1896 he published the first climate model of its kind projecting that halving CO2 levels could have produced a drop in temperature initiating an ice age Arrhenius calculated the temperature increase expected from doubling CO2 to be around 56\u00a0C417 Other scientists were initially skeptical and believed that the greenhouse effect was saturated so that adding more CO2 would make no difference and that the climate would be self-regulating418 Beginning in 1938 Guy Stewart Callendar published evidence that climate was warming and CO2 levels were rising419 but his calculations met the same objections418\nIn the 1950s Gilbert Plass created a detailed computer model that included different atmospheric layers and the infrared spectrum This model predicted that increasing CO2 levels would cause warming Around the same time Hans Suess found evidence that CO2 levels had been rising and Roger Revelle showed that the oceans would not absorb the increase The two scientists subsequently helped Charles Keeling to begin a record of continued increase which has been termed the Keeling Curve418 Scientists alerted the public424 and the dangers were highlighted at James Hansens 1988 Congressional testimony29 The Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC set up in 1988 to provide formal advice to the worlds governments spurred interdisciplinary research425 As part of the IPCC reports scientists assess the scientific discussion that takes place in peer-reviewed journal articles426\nThere is a near-complete scientific consensus that the climate is warming and that this is caused by human activities As of 2019 agreement in recent literature reached over 99421422 No scientific body of national or international standing disagrees with this view427 Consensus has further developed that some form of action should be taken to protect people against the impacts of climate change National science academies have called on world leaders to cut global emissions428 The 2021 IPCC Assessment Report stated that it is unequivocal that climate change is caused by humans422\nThis article incorporates text from a free content work  Licensed under CC BY-SA 30 license statementpermission Text taken from The status of women in agrifood systems  Overview  FAO

    "content": "Climate change affects the physical environment ecosystems and human societies Changes in the climate system include an overall warming trend more extreme weather and rising sea levels These in turn impact nature and wildlife as well as human settlements and societies6 The effects of human-caused climate change are broad and far-reaching This is especially so if there is no significant climate action Experts sometimes describe the projected and observed negative impacts of climate change as the climate crisis\nThe changes in climate are not uniform across the Earth In particular most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas The Arctic is warming faster than most other regions7 There are many effects of climate change on oceans These include an increase in ocean temperatures a rise in sea level from ocean warming and ice sheet melting They include increased ocean stratification They also include changes to ocean currents including a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation4\u200a10\u200a Carbon dioxide from the atmosphere is acidifiying the ocean8\nRecent warming has had a big effect on natural biological systems9\u200a81\u200a It has degraded land by raising temperatures drying soils and increasing wildfire risk10\u200a9\u200a Species all over the world are migrating towards the poles to colder areas On land many species move to higher ground whereas marine species seek colder water at greater depths11 At 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F of warming around 10 of species on land would become critically endangered12\u200a259\nFood security and access to fresh water are at risk due to rising temperatures Climate change has profound impacts on human health These can be direct impacts via heat stress They can be indirect changes via the spread of infectious diseases Humans are vulnerable and exposed to climate change in different ways This varies by economic sector and by country Wealthy industrialised countries which have emitted the most CO2 have more resources So they are the least vulnerable to global warming13 Climate change affects many economic sectors They include agriculture fisheries forestry energy insurance and tourism Some groups may be particularly at risk from climate change such as the poor women children and indigenous peoples14\u200a796\u200a15\u200a373376\u200a Climate change can lead to displacement and changes in migration flows16\nGlobal warming affects all parts of Earths climate system18 Global surface temperatures have risen by 11\u00a0C 20\u00a0F Scientists say they will rise further in the future1920 The changes in climate are not uniform across the Earth In particular most land areas have warmed faster than most ocean areas The Arctic is warming faster than most other regions7 Night-time temperatures have increased faster than daytime temperatures21 The impact on nature and people depends on how much more the Earth warms14\u200a787\nScientists use several methods to predict the effects of human-caused climate change One is to investigate past natural changes in climate22 To assess changes in Earths past climate scientists have studied tree rings ice cores corals and ocean and lake sediments23 These show that recent temperatures have surpassed anything in the last 2000 years24 By the end of the 21st century temperatures may increase to a level last seen in the mid-Pliocene This was around 3 million years ago25\u200a322\u200a At that time mean global temperatures were about 24\u00a0C 3672\u00a0F warmer than pre-industrial temperatures The global mean sea level was up to 25 metres 82\u00a0ft higher than it is today26\u200a323\u200a The modern observed rise in temperature and CO2 concentrations has been rapid even abrupt geophysical events in Earths history do not approach current rates27\u200a54\nHow much the world warms depends on human greenhouse gas emissions and how sensitive the climate is to greenhouse gases28 The more carbon dioxide CO2 is emitted in the 21st century the hotter the world will be by 2100 For a doubling of greenhouse gas concentrations the global mean temperature would rise by about 254\u00a0C 4572\u00a0F29 What would happen if emissions of CO2 stopped abruptly and there was no use of negative emission technologies The Earths climate would not start moving back to its pre-industrial state Temperatures would stay at the same high level for several centuries After about a thousand years 20 to 30 of human-emitted CO2 would remain in the atmosphere The ocean and land would not have taken  them This would commit the climate to a warmer state long after emissions have stopped30\nWith current mitigation policies the temperature will be about 27\u00a0C 2036\u00a0C above pre-industrial levels by 2100 It would rise to 24\u00a0C 43\u00a0F if governments achieve all unconditional pledges and targets they have made If all the countries that have set or are considering net-zero targets achieve them the temperature will rise by around 18\u00a0C 32\u00a0F There is a big gap between national plans and commitments and the actions that governments have taken around the world31\nThe lower and middle atmosphere where nearly all weather occurs are heating due to the greenhouse effect32 Evaporation and atmospheric moisture content increase as temperatures rise33 Water vapour is a greenhouse gas so this process is a self-reinforcing feedback34\nThe excess water vapour also gets caught up in storms This makes them more intense larger and potentially longer-lasting This in turn causes rain and snow events to become stronger and leads to increased risk of flooding Extra drying worsens natural dry spells and droughts This increases risk of heat waves and wildfires33 Scientists have identified human activities as the cause of recent climate trends They are now able to estimate the impact of climate change on extreme weather events They call this process extreme event attribution For instance such research can look at historical data for a region and conclude that a specific heat wave was more intense due to climate change35 In addition  the time shifts of the season onsets changes in the length of the season durations have been reported in many regions of the world3637383940 As a result of this the timing of the extreme weather events such as heavy precipitaions and heat waves is changing in parallel with season shifting\nHeatwaves over land have become more frequent and more intense in almost all world regions since the 1950s due to climate change Heat waves are more likely to occur simultaneously with droughts Marine heatwaves are twice as likely as they were in 198044 Climate change will lead to more very hot days and fewer very cold days45\u200a7\u200a There are fewer cold waves42\u200a8\nExperts can often attribute the intensity of individual heat waves to global warming Some extreme events would have been nearly impossible without human influence on the climate system A heatwave that would occur once every ten years before global warming started now occurs 28 times as often Under further warming heatwaves are set to become more frequent An event that would occur every ten years would occur every other year if global warming reaches 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F46\nHeat stress is related to temperature It also increases if humidity is higher The wet-bulb temperature measures both temperature and humidity Humans cannot adapt to a wet-bulb temperature above 35\u00a0C 95\u00a0F This heat stress can kill people If global warming is kept below 15 or 2\u00a0C 27 or 36\u00a0F it will probably be possible to avoid this deadly heat and humidity in most of the tropics But there may still be negative health impacts4748\nThere is some evidence climate change is leading to a weakening of the polar vortex This would make the jet stream more wavy49 This would lead to outbursts of very cold winter weather across parts of Eurasia50 and North America and incursions of very warm air into the Arctic515253\nWarming increases global average precipitation Precipitation is when water vapour condenses out of clouds such as rain and snow54\u200a1057\u200a Higher temperatures increase evaporation and surface drying As the air warms it can hold more water For every degree Celsius it can hold 7 more water vapour54\u200a1057\u200a Scientists have observed changes in the amount intensity frequency and type of precipitation55 Overall climate change is causing longer hot dry spells broken by more intense rainfall56\u200a151\u200a154\nClimate change has increased contrasts in rainfall amounts between wet and dry seasons Wet seasons are getting wetter and dry seasons are getting drier In the northern high latitudes warming has also caused an increase in the amount of snow and rain54\u200a1057\u200a In the Southern Hemisphere the rain associated with the storm tracks has shifted south Changes in monsoons vary a lot More monsoon systems are becoming wetter than drier In Asia summer monsoons are getting wetter The West African monsoon is getting wetter over the central Sahel and drier in the far western Sahel54\u200a1058\nStorms become wetter under climate change These include tropical cyclones and extratropical cyclones Both the maximum and mean rainfall rates increase This more extreme rainfall is also true for thunderstorms in some regions57 Furthermore tropical cyclones and storm tracks are moving towards the poles This means some regions will see large changes in maximum wind speeds5758 Scientists expect there will be fewer tropical cyclones But they expect their strength  to increase58 There has probably been an increase in the number of tropical cyclones that intensify rapidly57  Meteorological and seismological data indicate a widespread increase in wind-driven global ocean wave energy in recent decades that has been attributed to an increase in storm intensity over the oceans due to climate change 59 6061\nDue to an increase in heavy rainfall events floods are likely to become more severe when they do occur54\u200a1155\u200a The interactions between rainfall and flooding are complex There are some regions in which flooding is expected to become rarer This depends on several factors These include changes in rain and snowmelt but also soil moisture54\u200a1156\u200a Climate change leaves soils drier in some areas so they may absorb rainfall more quickly This leads to less flooding Dry soils can also become harder In this case heavy rainfall runs off  into rivers and lakes This increases risks of flooding54\u200a1155\nClimate change affects many factors associated with droughts These include how much rain falls and how fast the rain evaporates again Warming over land increases the severity and frequency of droughts around much of the world6554\u200a1057\u200a In some tropical and subtropical regions of the world there will probably be less rain due to global warming This will make them more prone to drought Droughts are set to worsen in many regions of the world These include Central America the Amazon and south-western South America They also include West and Southern Africa The Mediterranean and south-western Australia are also some of these regions54\u200a1157\nHigher temperatures increase evaporation This dries the soil and increases plant stress Agriculture suffers as a result This means even regions where overall rainfall is expected to remain relatively stable will experience these impacts54\u200a1157\u200a These regions include central and northern Europe Without climate change mitigation around one third of land areas are likely to experience moderate or more severe drought by 210054\u200a1157\u200a Due to global warming droughts are more frequent and intense than in the past66\nSeveral impacts make their impacts worse These are increased water demand population growth and urban expansion in many areas67 Land restoration can help reduce the impact of droughts One example of this is agroforestry68\nClimate change promotes the type of weather that makes wildfires more likely In some areas an increase of wildfires has been attributed directly to climate change Evidence from Earths past also shows more fire in warmer periods70 Climate change increases evaporation This can cause vegetation to dry out When a fire starts in an area with very dry vegetation it can spread rapidly Higher temperatures can also lengthen the fire season This is the time of year in which severe wildfires are most likely particularly in regions where snow is disappearing71\nWeather conditions are raising the risks of wildfires But the total area burnt by wildfires has decreased This is mostly because savanna has been converted to cropland so there are fewer trees to burn Prescribed burning isan indigenous practice in the US and Australia It can reduce wildfire burning71 The carbon released from wildfires can add to greenhouse gas concentrations Climate models do not yet full reflect this feedback42\u200a20\nThere are many effects of climate change on oceans One of the main ones is an increase in ocean temperatures More frequent marine heatwaves are linked to this The rising temperature contributes to a rise in sea levels Other effects include ocean acidification sea ice decline increased ocean stratification and reductions in oxygen levels Changes to ocean currents including a weakening of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation are another important effect75 All these changes have knock-on effects which disturb marine ecosystems76 The main cause of these changes is climate change due to human emissions of greenhouse gases Carbon dioxide and methane are examples of greenhouse gases This leads to ocean warming because the ocean takes up most of the additional heat in the climate system77 The ocean absorbs some of the extra carbon dioxide in the atmosphere This causes the pH value of the ocean to drop78 Scientists estimate that the ocean absorbs about 25 of all human-caused CO2 emissions78\nOcean temperature stratification is the difference in temperature between the various layers of the ocean It increases as the ocean surface warms due to rising air temperatures79\u200a471\u200a The decline in mixing of the ocean layers stabilizes warm water near the surface It also reduces cold deep water circulation The reduced vertical mixing makes it harder for the ocean to absorb heat So a larger share of future warming goes into the atmosphere and land One result is an increase in the amount of energy available for tropical cyclones and other storms Another result is a decrease in nutrients for fish in the upper ocean layers These changes also reduce the oceans capacity to store carbon80 At the same time contrasts in salinity are increasing Salty areas are becoming saltier and fresher areas less salty81\nBetween 1901 and 2018 average global sea level rose by 1525\u00a0cm 610\u00a0in an average of 12\u00a0mm 00390079\u00a0in per year83 This rate accelerated to 462\u00a0mm 0182\u00a0inyr for the decade 2013202284 Climate change due to human activities is the main cause85\u200a5\u200a8\u200a Between 1993 and 2018 thermal expansion of water accounted for 42 of sea level rise Melting temperate glaciers accounted for 21 while polar glaciers in Greenland accounted for 15 and those in Antarctica for 886\u200a1576\u200a Sea level rise lags changes in the Earths temperature and sea level rise will therefore continue to accelerate between now and 2050 in response to warming that has already happened87 What happens after that depends on human greenhouse gas emissions Sea level rise may slow down between 2050 and 2100 if there are deep cuts in emissions It could then reach slightly over 30\u00a0cm 1\u00a0ft from now by 2100 With high emissions it may accelerate It could rise by 1\u00a0m 312\u00a0ft or even 2\u00a0m 612\u00a0ft by then8588 In the long run sea level rise would amount to 23\u00a0m 710\u00a0ft over the next 2000 years if warming amounts to 15\u00a0C 27\u00a0F It would be 1922 metres 6272\u00a0ft if warming peaks at 5\u00a0C 90\u00a0F85\u200a21\nThe cryosphere the area of the Earth covered by snow or ice is extremely sensitive to changes in global climate98 There has been an extensive loss of snow on land since 1981 Some of the largest declines have been observed in the spring99 During the 21st century snow cover is projected to continue its retreat in almost all regions100\u200a3969\nSince the beginning of the twentieth century there has been a widespread retreat of glaciers101\u200a1215\u200a Those glaciers that are not associated with the polar ice sheets lost around 8 of their mass between 1971 and 2019101\u200a1275\u200a In the Andes in South America and in the Himalayas in Asia the retreat of glaciers could impact water supply102103 The melting of those glaciers could also cause landslides or glacial lake outburst floods104\nThe melting of the Greenland and West Antarctic ice sheets will continue to contribute to sea level rise over long time-scales The Greenland ice sheet loss is mainly driven by melt from the top  Antarctic ice loss is driven by warm ocean water melting the outlet glaciers101\u200a1215\nFuture melt of the West Antarctic ice sheet is potentially abrupt under a high emission scenario as a consequence of a partial collapse105\u200a595596\u200a Part of the ice sheet is grounded on bedrock below sea level This makes it possibly vulnerable to the self-enhancing process of marine ice sheet instability Marine ice cliff instability could also contribute to a partial collapse But there is limited evidence for its importance101\u200a12691270\u200a A partial collapse of the ice sheet would lead to rapid sea level rise and a local decrease in ocean salinity It would be irreversible for decades and possibly even millennia105\u200a595596\u200a The complete loss of the West Antarctic ice sheet would cause over 5 metres 16\u00a0ft of sea level rise106\nIn contrast to the West Antarctic ice sheet melt of the Greenland ice sheet is projected to take place more gradually over millennia105\u200a595596\u200a Sustained warming between 1\u00a0C 18\u00a0F low confidence and 4\u00a0C 72\u00a0F medium confidence would lead to a complete loss of the ice sheet This would contribute 7\u00a0m 23\u00a0ft to sea levels globally26\u200a363\u200a The ice loss could become irreversible due to a further self-enhancing feedback This is called the elevation-surface mass balance feedback When ice melts on top of the ice sheet the elevation drops Air temperature is higher at lower altitudes so this promotes further melting26\u200a362\nSea ice reflects 50 to 70 of the incoming solar radiation back into space Only 6 of incoming solar energy is reflected by the ocean108 As the climate warms the area covered by snow or sea ice decreases After sea ice melts more energy is absorbed by the ocean so it warms up This ice-albedo feedback is a self-reinforcing feedback of climate change109 Large-scale measurements of sea ice have only been possible since satellites came into use110\nSea ice in the Arctic has declined in recent decades in area and volume due to climate change It has been melting more in summer than it refreezes in winter The decline of sea ice in the Arctic has been accelerating during the early twenty-first century It has a rate of decline  of 47 per decade It has declined over 50 since the first satellite records111112113 Ice-free summers are expected to be rare at 15\u00a0C 27\u00a0F degrees of warming They are set to occur at least once every decade with a warming level of 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F114\u200a8\u200a The Arctic will likely become ice-free at the end of some summers before 2050101\u200a9\nSea ice extent in Antarctica varies a lot year by year This makes it difficult to determine a trend and record highs and record lows have been observed between 2013 and 2023 The general trend since 1979 the start of the satellite measurements has been roughly flat Between 2015 and 2023 there has been a decline in sea ice but due to the high variability this does not correspond to a significant trend115\nGlobally permafrost warmed by about 03\u00a0C between 2007 and 2016 The extent of permafrost has been falling for decades More decline is expected in the future101\u200a1280\u200a Permafrost thaw makes the ground weaker and unstable The thaw can seriously damage human infrastructure  in permafrost areas such as railways settlements and pipelines116\u200a236\u200a Thawing soil can also release methane and CO2 from decomposing microbes This can generate a strong feedback loop to global warming117118 Some scientists believe that carbon storage in permafrost globally is approximately 1600 gigatons This is twice the atmospheric pool119\nRecent warming has had a big effect on natural biological systems9\u200a81\u200a Species worldwide are moving poleward to colder areas On land species may move to higher elevations Marine species find colder water at greater depths11 Climate change had the third biggest impact on nature out of various factors in the five decades up to 2020 Only change in land use and sea use and direct exploitation of organisms had a bigger impact120\nThe impacts of climate change on nature are likely to become bigger in the next few decades121 The stresses caused by climate change combine with other stresses on ecological systems such as land conversion land degradation harvesting and pollution They threaten substantial damage to unique ecosystems They can even result in their complete loss and the extinction of species122123 This can disrupt key interactions between species within ecosystems This is because species from one location do not leave the warming habitat at the same rate The result is rapid changes in the way the ecosystem functions11 Impacts include changes in regional rainfall patterns Another is earlier leafing of trees and plants over many regions Movements of species to higher latitudes and altitudes124 changes in bird migrations and shifting of the oceans plankton and fish from cold- to warm-adapted communities are other impacts125\nThese changes of land and ocean ecosystems have direct effects on human well-being126127 For instance ocean ecosystems help with coastal protection and provide food127 Freshwater and land ecosystems can provide water for human consumption Furthermore these ecosystems can store carbon This helps to stabilize the climate system126\nClimate change is a major driver of biodiversity loss in different land types These include cool conifer forests savannas mediterranean-climate systems tropical forests and the Arctic tundra128\u200a239\u200a In other ecosystems land-use change may be a stronger driver of biodiversity loss at least in the near term128\u200a239\u200a Beyond 2050 climate change may be the major cause of biodiversity loss globally128\u200a239\u200a Climate change interacts with other pressures These include habitat modification pollution and invasive species Through this interaction climate change increases the risk of extinction for many terrestrial and freshwater species129 At 12\u00a0C 22\u00a0F of warming around 2023130 some ecosystems are threatened by mass die-offs of trees and from heatwaves131 At 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F of warming around 10 of species on land would become critically endangered This differs by group For instance insects and salamanders are more vulnerable12\u200a259\nRainfall on the Amazon rainforest is recycled when it evaporates back into the atmosphere instead of running off away from the rainforest This water is essential for sustaining the rainforest Due to deforestation the rainforest is losing this ability This effect is even worse because  climate change brings more frequent droughts to the area The higher frequency of droughts in the first two decades of the 21st century and other data signal that a tipping point from rainforest to savanna might be close A 2019 study concluded that this ecosystem could begin a 50-year-long collapse to a savanna around 2021 After that it would become increasingly and disproportionally more difficult to prevent or reverse this shift133134135\nMarine heatwaves are happening more often They have widespread impacts on life in the oceans These include mass dying events and coral bleaching137 Harmful algae blooms have increased This is in response to warming waters loss of oxygen and eutrophication138\u200a451\u200a Melting sea ice destroys habitat including for algae that grows on its underside139\nOcean acidification can harm marine organisms in various ways Shell-forming organisms like oysters are particularly vulnerable Some phytoplankton and seagrass species may benefit However some of these are toxic to fish phytoplankton species Their spread poses risks to fisheries and aquaculture Fighting pollution can reduce the impact of acidification140\nWarm-water coral reefs are very sensitive to global warming and ocean acidification Coral reefs provide a habitat for thousands of species They provide ecosystem services such as coastal protection and food But 7090 of todays warm-water coral reefs will disappear even if warming is kept to 15\u00a0C 27\u00a0F141\u200a179\u200a Coral reefs are framework organisms They build physical structures that form habitats for other sea creatures Other framework organisms are also at risk from climate change Mangroves and seagrass are considered to be at moderate risk from lower levels of global warming141\u200a225\nFeedbacks that reinforce themselves can make climate change worse145 The climate system exhibits threshold behaviour or tipping points when these feedbacks lead parts of the Earth system into a new state Examples are the runaway loss of ice sheets or the dieback of forests146147 Tipping behaviour is found in all parts of the climate system These include ecosystems ice sheets and the circulation of the ocean and atmosphere148 Tipping points are studied using data from Earths distant past and by physical modelling146 There is already moderate risk of global tipping points at 1\u00a0C 18\u00a0F above pre-industrial temperatures That becomes a high risk  at 25\u00a0C 45\u00a0F141\u200a254\u200a258\u200a It is possible that some tipping points are close or have already been crossed Examples are the West Antarctic and Greenland ice sheets the Amazon rainforest and warm-water coral reefs149\nTipping points are perhaps the most dangerous aspect of future climate change They would lead to irreversible impacts on society150 A collapse of the Atlantic meridional overturning circulation would likely halve rainfall in India It would probably lead to severe drops in temperature in Northern Europe151 Many tipping points are interlinked This means triggering one may lead to a cascade of effects152 This could happen even well below 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F of warming153 A 2018 study states that 45 of environmental problems including those caused by climate change are interconnected This makes the risk of a domino effect bigger154155\nFurther impacts may be irreversible at least over the timescale of many human generations156\u200a785\u200a This includes warming of the deep ocean and acidification These are set to continue even when global temperatures stop rising157 In biological systems the extinction of species would be an irreversible impact156\u200a785\u200a In social systems unique cultures may be lost156\u200a785\u200a Climate change could make it more likely that endangered languages disappear158\nHumans have a climate niche This is a certain range of temperatures in which they flourish Outside that niche conditions are less favourable This leads to negative effects on health food security and more This niche is a mean annual temperature below 29\u00a0C As of May 2023 60 million people lived outside this niche With every additional 01 degree of warming 140 million people will be pushed out of it159\nThe effects of climate change on human health are increasingly well studied and quantified160161 Rising temperatures and changes in weather patterns are increasing the frequency and severity of heat waves wildfires droughts floods landslides hurricanes and other causes of injury and illness Heat waves and extreme weather events have a big impact on health both directly and indirectly Direct effects of exposure to high and extended temperatures include illness reduced labour capacity for outdoor workers and heat-related mortality162\nIn addition to direct impacts climate change and extreme weather events cause changes in the biosphere Climate-sensitive pathogens and vector-borne diseases may increase in some regions Changes in temperature are creating conditions favorable to mosquito-borne diseases such as dengue fever and waterborne diseases including diarrhoeal disease162163 Climate change will impact where infectious diseases are able to spread in the future Many infectious diseases will spread to new geographic areas where people have not previously been exposed or developed immunity164165\nThe effects of climate change on mental health and wellbeing are documented This is especially the case for vulnerable populations and those with pre-existing serious mental illness168 There are three broad pathways by which these effects can take place directly indirectly or via awareness169 The direct pathway includes stress-related conditions caused by exposure to extreme weather events These include post-traumatic stress disorder PTSD Scientific studies have linked mental health to several climate-related exposures These include heat humidity rainfall drought wildfires and floods170 The indirect pathway can be disruption to economic and social activities An example is when an area of farmland is less able to produce food170 The third pathway can be of mere awareness of the climate change threat even by individuals who are not otherwise affected by it169\nClimate change will affect agriculture and food production around the world The reasons include the effects of elevated CO2 in the atmosphere Higher temperatures and altered precipitation and transpiration regimes are also factors Increased frequency of extreme events and modified weed pest and pathogen pressure are other factors176\u200a282\u200a Droughts result in crop failures and the loss of pasture for livestock177 Loss and poor growth of livestock cause milk yield and meat production to decrease178 The rate of soil erosion is 1020 times higher than the rate of soil accumulation in agricultural areas that use no-till farming In areas with tilling it is 100 times higher Climate change worsens this type of land degradation and desertification10\u200a5\nClimate change is projected to negatively affect all four pillars of food security It will affect how much food is available It will also affect how easy food is to access through prices food quality and how stable the food system is179 Climate change is already affecting the productivity of wheat and other staples180181\nIn many areas fishery catches are already decreasing because of global warming and changes in biochemical cycles In combination with overfishing warming waters decrease the amount of fish in the ocean4\u200a12\u200a Per degree of warming ocean biomass is expected to decrease by about 5 Tropical and subtropical oceans are most affected while there may be more fish in polar waters182\nWater resources can be affected by climate change in various ways The total amount of freshwater available can change for instance due to dry spells or droughts Heavy rainfall and flooding can have an impact on water quality They can transport pollutants into water bodies through increased surface runoff In coastal regions more salt may find its way into water resources due to higher sea levels and more intense storms Higher temperatures also directly degrade water quality This is because warm water contains less oxygen183 Changes in the water cycle threaten existing and future water infrastructure It will be harder to plan investments for water infrastructure This is because there are significant uncertainties about future variability of the water cycle184\nBetween 15 and 25 billion people live in areas with regular water security issues If global warming reaches 4\u00a0C 72\u00a0F water insecurity would affect about twice as many people183 Water resources are likely to decrease in most dry subtropical regions and mid-latitudes But they will increase in high latitudes However variable streamflow means even regions with increased water resources can experience additional short-term shortages185\u200a251\u200a In the arid regions of India China the US and Africa dry spells and drought are already affecting  water availability183\nClimate change is particularly likely to affect the Arctic Africa small islands Asian megadeltas and the Middle East regions186187 Low-latitude less-developed regions are most at risk of experiencing negative climate change impacts156\u200a795796\u200a The ten countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations ASEAN are among the most vulnerable in the world to the negative effects of climate change ASEANs climate mitigation efforts are not in proportion to the climate change threats the region faces188\nRegions inhabited by a third of the human population could become as hot as the hottest parts of the Sahara within 50 years This would happen if greenhouse gas emissions continue to grow rapdily without a change in patterns of population growth and without migration The projected average temperature of above 29\u00a0C 84\u00a0F for these regions would be outside the human temperature niche This is a range for climate that is biologically suitable for humans It is  based on historical data of mean annual temperatures The most affected regions have little adaptive capacity190191\nIncreased extreme heat exposure from climate change and the urban heat island effect threatens urban settlements192 This is made worse by the loss of shade from urban trees that cannot withstand the heat stress193\nIn 2019 the Crowther Lab from ETH Zurich paired the climatic conditions of 520 major cities worldwide with the predicted climatic conditions of cities in 2050 It found that 22 of the major cities would have climatic conditions that do not exist in any city today For instance 2050 London would have a climate similar to 2019 Melbourne in Australia Athens and Madrid would be like Fez in Morocco  Nairobi in Kenya would be like Maputo in Mozambique The Indian city Pune would be like Bamako in Mali and Bamako would be like Niamey in Niger Brasilia would be like Goiania both in Brazil194195\nLow-lying cities and other settlements near the sea face multiple simultaneous risks from climate change They face flooding risks from sea level rise In addition they may face impacts from more severe storms ocean acidification and salt intrusion into the groundwater  Changes like continued development in exposed areas increase the risks that these regions face196\nPopulation density on the coasts is high Estimates of the number of people at risk of coastal flooding from climate-driven sea level rise vary Estimates range from 190 million197 to 300 million It could even be 640 million in a worst-case scenario related to the instability of the Antarctic ice sheet198199 People are most affected in the densely-populated low-lying megadeltas of Asia and Africa200\nSmall island developing states are especially vulnerable They are likely to experience more intense storm surges salt water intrusion and coastal destruction201 Low-lying small islands in the Pacific Indian and Caribbean regions even risk permanent inundation This would displace their population202203204 On the islands of Fiji Tonga and western Samoa migrants from outer islands inhabit low and unsafe areas along the coasts204 The entire populations of small atoll nations such as Kiribati Maldives the Marshall Islands and Tuvalu are at risk of being displaced205202  This could raise issues of statelessness206 Several factors increase their vulnerability These are small size isolation from other land low financial resources and lack of protective infrastructure202\n\nClimate change has many impacts on society It affects health the availability of drinking water and food inequality and economic growth The effects of climate change are often interlinked They can exacerbate each other as well as existing vulnerabilities207208209 Some areas may become too hot for humans to live in210211 Climate-related changes or disasters may lead people in some areas to move to other parts of the country or to other countries\nSome scientists describe the effects of climate change with continuing increases in greenhouse gas emissions as a climate emergency or climate crisis212213 Some researchers214215 and activists216 describe them as an existential threat to civilization Some define these threats under climate security The consequences of climate change and the failure to address it can distract people from tackling its root causes This leads to what some researchers have termed a climate doom loop217\nDisplacement is when people move within a country Migration is when they move to another country Some people use the terms interchangeably Climate change affects displacement in several ways More frequent and severe weather-related disasters may increase involuntary displacement These destroy homes and habitats Climate impacts such as desertification and rising sea levels gradually erode livelihoods They force communities to abandon traditional homelands Other forms of migration are adaptive and voluntary They are based on individual or household decisions218\u200a1079\u200a On the other hand some households may fall into poverty or get poorer due to climate change This limits their ability to move to less affected areas219\nMigration due to climate and weather is usually within countries But it is long-distance Slow-onset disasters such as droughts and heat are more likely to cause long-term migration than weather disasters like floods219 Migration due to desertification and reduced soil fertility is typically from rural areas in developing countries to towns and cities220\u200a109\nAccording to the Internal Displacement Monitoring Centre extreme weather events displaced approximately 30 million people in 2020 Violence and wars displaced approximately 10 million in the same year There may have been a contribution of climate change to these conflicts221222 In 2018 the World Bank estimated that climate change will cause internal migration of between 31 and 143 million people by 2050 This would be as they escape crop failures water scarcity and sea level rise The study covered only Sub-Saharan Africa South Asia and Latin America223224\nClimate change is unlikely to cause international wars in the foreseeable future There is increasing consensus among experts that climate change increases the risk for intrastate conflicts such as civil wars communal violence or protests225 The most recent IPCC report concludes Climate hazards have affected armed conflict within countries medium confidence but the influence of climate is small compared to socio-economic political and cultural factors high confidence226\nClimate change can increase conflict risks by causing tensions about scarce resources like food water and land by weakening state institutions by reducing the opportunity costs for impoverished individuals to join armed groups and by causing tensions related to climate-induced migration227226 Recently experts have expressed concerns that efforts to mitigate or adapt to climate change can also cause conflicts for instance due to higher food and energy prices or when people are forcibly re-located from vulnerable areas228229\nResearch has shown that climate change is not the most important conflict driver and that it can only affect conflict risks under certain circumstances225 Relevant context factors include agricultural dependence a history of political instability poverty and the political exclusion of ethnic groups230231232 Climate change has thus been described as a threat multiplier233 Yet an impact of climate change on specific conflicts like the Syrian civil war234235 or the armed conflict in Darfur236237 remains hard to proof\nIn some cases climate change could also decrease conflict risks This happens either if climate-related disasters impose financial and logistical constraints on conflict parties232238 or if various social groups come together to cooperate about the shared challenge of climate change environmental peacebuilding239240\nEconomic forecasts of the impact of global warming vary considerably The impacts are worse if there is insufficient adaptation241 Economic modelling may underrate the impact of catastrophic climatic changes When estimating losses economists choose a discount rate This determines how much one prefers to have goods or cash now compared to at a future date Using a high discount rate may understate economic losses This is because losses for future generations weigh less heavily242\nEconomic impacts are bigger the more the temperature rises243 Scientists have compared impacts with warming of 15\u00a0C 27\u00a0F and a level of 366\u00a0C 659\u00a0F They use this higher figure to represent no efforts to stop emissions They found that total damages at 15\u00a0C were 90 less than at 366\u00a0C 141\u200a256\u200a One study found that global GDP at the end of the century would be 35 less if warming is limited to 3\u00a0C 54\u00a0F This study excludes the potential effect of tipping points Another study found that excluding tipping points underestimates the global economic impact by a factor of two to eight141\u200a256\u200a Another study found that a temperature rise of 2\u00a0C 36\u00a0F by 2050 would reduce global GDP by 2575 By 2100 in this scenario the temperature would rise by 4\u00a0C 72\u00a0F This could reduce global GDP by 30 in the worst case244\nGlobal losses reveal rapidly rising costs due to extreme weather events since the 1970s9\u200a110\u200a Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global losses These factors include population growth and increased wealth245 Regional climatic factors also play a role These include changes in precipitation and flooding events It is difficult to quantify the relative impact of socio-economic factors and climate change on the observed trend246 The trend does suggest social systems are increasing vulnerable to climate change246\nClimate change has contributed to global economic inequality Wealthy countries in colder regions have felt little overall economic impact from climate change or may have benefited Poor hotter countries probably grew less than if there had been no global warming248249\nClimate change has a bigger impact on economic sectors directly affected by weather than on other sectors250 It heavily affects agriculture fisheries and forestry251 It also affects the tourism and energy sectors250 Agriculture and forestry have suffered economic losses due to droughts and extreme heat252 If global warming goes over 15 C there may be limits to how much tourism and outdoor work can adapt253\nIn the energy sector thermal power plants depend on water to cool them Climate change can increase the likelihood of drought and fresh water shortages Higher operating temperatures make them less efficient This reduces their output254 Hydropower is affected by changes in the water cycle such as river flows Diminished river flows can cause power shortages in areas that depend on hydroelectric power Brazil relies on hydroelectricity So it is particularly vulnerable Rising temperatures lower water flow and changes in rainfall could reduce total energy production by 7 annually by the end of the century254 Climate change affects oil and natural gas infrastructure This is also vulnerable to the increased risk of disasters such as storms cyclones flooding and rising sea levels255\nGlobal warming affects the insurance and financial services sectors141\u200a212213\u200a228\u200a252\u200a Insurance is an important tool to manage risks But it is often unavailable to poorer households Due to climate change premiums are going up for certain types of insurance such as flood insurance Poor adaptation to climate change further widens the gap between what people can afford and the costs of insurance as risks increase256 In 2019 Munich Re said climate change could make home insurance unaffordable for households at or below average incomes257\nIt is possible that climate change has already begun to affect the shipping sector by impacting the Panama Canal Lack of rainfall possibly linked to climate change reduced the number of ships passing through the canal per day from 36 to 22 and by February 2024 it is expected to be 18258\nClimate change does not affect people within communities in the same way It can have a bigger impact on vulnerable groups such as women the elderly religious minorities and refugees than on others259\nClimate change has long been described as a severe risk to humans Climate change as an existential threat has emerged as a key theme in the climate movement People from small island nations also use this theme There has not been extensive research in this topic Existential risks are threats that could cause the extinction of humanity or destroy the potential of intelligent life on Earth268 Key risks of climate change do not fit that definition However some key climate risks do have an impact peoples ability to survive For instance areas may become too hot to survive or sea level rise may make it impossible to live at a specific location269270268\nIn 2021 researchers found that projecting effects of greenhouse gas emissions only for up to 2100 as widely practiced in research and policy-making is short-sighted They then modeled RCPs climate change scenarios and their effects for up to 2500271272",

    "content": "The economic analysis of climate change explains how economic thinking tools and techniques are applied to calculate the magnitude and distribution of damage caused by climate change It also informs the policies and approaches for mitigation and adaptation to climate change from global to household scales This topic is also inclusive of alternative economic approaches including ecological economics and degrowth In a costbenefit analysis the trade offs between climate change impacts adaptation and mitigation are made explicit Costbenefit analyses of climate change are produced using integrated assessment models IAMs which incorporate aspects of the natural social and economic sciences The total economic impacts from climate change are difficult to estimate but increase for higher temperature changes1\nClimate change impacts can be measured as an economic cost2\u200a936941\u200a This is particularly well-suited to market impacts that is impacts that are linked to market transactions and directly affect GDP However monetary measures of non-market impacts eg impacts on human health and ecosystems are more difficult to calculate Economic analysis of climate change is challenging as it is a long-term problem and has substantial distributional issues within and across countries Furthermore it engages with uncertainty about the physical damages of climate changes human responses and future socioeconomic development\nIn most models benefits exceed costs for stabilization of GHGs leading to warming of 25\u00a0C No models suggest that the optimal policy is to do nothing ie allow business-as-usual emissions\nSub-topics within the economic analysis concept are the economic impacts of climate change as well as the economics of climate change mitigation Climate change mitigation consist of human actions to reduce greenhouse gas emissions or to enhance carbon sinks that absorb greenhouse gases from the atmosphere3\u200a2239\nEconomic analysis of climate change is an umbrella term for a range of investigations into the economic costs around the effects of climate change and for preventing or softening those effects These investigations can serve any of the following purposes4\u200a2495\nThe economic impacts of climate change also include any mitigation for example limiting the global average temperature below 2\u00a0C or adaption for example building flood defences employed by nations or groups of nations which might infer economic consequences567 They also take into account that some regions or sectors benefit from low levels of warming for example through lower energy demand or agricultural advantages in some markets4\u200a2496\u200a8\u200a11\nThere are wider policy and policy coherence considerations of interest For example in some areas policies designed to mitigate climate change may contribute positively towards other sustainable development objectives such as abolishing fossil fuel subsidies which would reduce air pollution and thus save lives91011 Direct global fossil fuel subsidies reached 319\u00a0billion in 2017 and 52\u00a0trillion when indirect costs such as air pollution are priced in12 In other areas the cost of climate change mitigation may divert resources away from other socially and environmentally beneficial investments the opportunity costs of climate change policy910\nGlobal aggregate costs adds up the total potential impacts of climate change in all market sectors eg the costs to agriculture energy services or tourism It also includes other non-market impacts eg on ecosystems and human health for which it is possible to assign monetary values4\u200a2495\nGlobal estimates are often based on an aggregation of independent sector andor regional studies and results Producing comprehensive global economic estimates is however very challenging The interactions that need to be modelled are very complex For example there is uncertainty in how physical and natural systems may respond to climate change Potential socioeconomic changes including how human societies might mitigate and adapt to climate change also need to be considered4\u200a2496\u200a The uncertainty and complexities associated with climate change and have led analysts to develop scenarios though which they can explore different possibilities\nGlobal economic losses due to extreme weather climate and water events are increasing Costs have increased sevenfold from the 1970s to the 2010s13\u200a16\u200a Direct losses from disasters have averaged above US330 billion annually between 2015 and 202114\u200a21\u200a Climate change has contributed to the increased probability and magnitude of extreme events When a vulnerable community is exposed to extreme climate or weather events disasters can occur Socio-economic factors have contributed to the observed trend of global disaster losses such as population growth and increased wealth15 This shows that increased exposure is the most important driver of losses However part of these are also due to human-induced climate change Extreme Event Attribution quantifies how climate change is altering the probability and magnitude of extreme events On a case-by-case basis it is feasible to estimate how the magnitude andor probability of the extreme event has shifted due to climate change These attributable changes have been identified for many individual extreme heat events and rainfall events16\u200a1611\u200a17 Using all available data on attributable changes one study estimated the global losses to average US143 billion per year between 2000 and 2019 This includes a statistical loss of life value of 90 billion and economic damages of 53 billion per year17\nEstimates of the economic impacts from climate change in future years are most often measured as percent global GDP change relative to GDP without additional climate change4\u200a2495\u200a The 2022 IPCC report compared the latest estimates of many modelling and meta-analysis studies It found wide variety in the results These vary depending on the assumptions used in the IPCC socioeconomic scenarios The same set of scenarios are used in all of the climate models\nEstimates are found to increase with global average temperature change The increase is non-linear Global temperature change projection ranges corresponding to each cost estimate are based on IPCC assessment on the physical science in the same report It finds that with high warming 4\u00a0C and low adaptation annual global GDP might be reduced by 1023 by 2100 because of climate change The same assessment finds smaller GDP changes with reductions of 18 assuming assuming low warming more adaptation and using different models4\u200a2459\u200a These global economic cost estimates do not take into account impacts on social well-being or welfare or distributional effects4\u200a2495\u200a Nor do they fully consider climate change adaptation responses\nOther studies investigate economic losses by GDP change per country or by per country per capita Findings show large differences among countries and within countries The estimated GDP changes in some developing countries are similar to some of the worst country-level losses during historical economic recessions4\u200a2459\u200a  Economic losses are risks to living standards which are more likely to be severe in developing countries Climate change can push more people into extreme poverty or keep people poor especially through particularly climate-sensitive sectors such as agriculture and fisheries Climate change may also increase income inequality within countries as well as between them particularly affecting low-income groups4\u200a2461\nIn 2017 climate change contributed to extreme weather events causing at least 100\u00a0billion in damages18 The impact can be seen over a longer time period where over the past 20 years an estimated 500000 people have died and US35\u00a0trillion was lost as a result of extreme weather events5 Increasing temperature will lead to accelerating economic losses19\u200a16\u200a A 2017 survey of independent economists looking at the effects of climate change found that future damage estimates range from 2 to 10 or more of global GDP per year20\nOne 2018 study found that potential global economic gains if countries implement mitigation strategies to comply with the 2\u00a0C target set at the Paris Agreement are in the vicinity of US17\u00a0trillion per year up to 2100 compared to a very high emission scenario21\nOne 2020 study estimated economic losses due to climate change could be between 127 and 616\u00a0trillion dollars extra until 2100 with current commitments compared to 15\u00a0C or well below 2\u00a0C compatible action action Failure to implement current commitments raises economic losses to 150792\u00a0trillion dollars until 2100 In this study mitigation was achieved by countries optimising their own economy22\nIn 2020 McKinsey  Company issued a report about the current and future impacts of climate change on the economy The report says that trillions of dollars and hundreds of millions of lives are at risk Climate change should strongly influence the decisions of the business and governmental leaders23 The report for example found that socioeconomic impacts can increase by 220 times compare to today level by 205024\nThe total economic impacts from climate change increase for higher temperature changes1 For instance total damages are estimated to be 90 less if global warming is limited to 15\u00a0C compared to 366\u00a0C a warming level chosen to represent no mitigation25 In an Oxford Economics study high emission scenario a temperature rise of 2 degrees by the year 2050 would reduce global GDP by 2575 By the year 2100 in this case the temperature would rise by 4 degrees which could reduce the global GDP by 30 in the worst case26\nA 2021 study by the reinsurance company Swiss Re estimated global climate change is likely to reduce global economic output by 1114 or as much as 23\u00a0trillion annually by 2050 compared with output without climate change According to this study the economies of wealthy countries like the US would likely shrink by approximately 7 while some developing nations would be devastated losing around 20 or in some cases 40 of their economic output27\nA number of economic sectors will be affected by climate change including the livestock forestry and fisheries industries Other sectors sensitive to climate change include the energy insurance tourism and recreation industries29\u200a2496\nAmong the health impacts that have been studied aggregate costs of heat stress through loss of work time have been estimated as have the costs of malnutrition30\u200a10745\u200a However it is usual for studies to aggregate the number of years of life lost adjusted for years living with disability to measure effects on health31\u200a1060\nIn 2019 the International Labour Organization published a report titled Working on a warmer planet The impact of heat stress on labour productivity and decent work in which it claims that even if the rise in temperature will be limited to 15 degree by the year 2030 Climate Change will cause losses in productivity reaching 22 of all the working hours every year This is equivalent to 80\u00a0million full-time jobs or 2400\u00a0billion dollars The sector expected to be most affected is agriculture which is projected to account for 60 of this loss The construction sector is also projected to be severely impacted and accounts for 19 of projected losses Other sectors that are most at risk are environmental goods and services refuse collection emergency repair work transport tourism sports and some forms of industrial work3233\nIt has been estimated that 35\u00a0million people die prematurely each year from air pollution from fossil fuels34 The health benefits of meeting climate goals substantially outweigh the costs of action35 The health benefits of phasing out fossil fuels measured in money estimated by economists using the value of life for each country are substantially more than the cost of achieving the 2 degree C goal of the Paris Agreement36\nCarbon-intensive industries and investors are expected to experience a significant increase in stranded assets42 with a potential ripple affect throughout the world economy4344\nA United States government report in November 2018 raised the possibility of US GDP going down 10 as a result of the warming climate including huge shifts in geography demographics and technology45\nSeveral factors affect mitigation cost estimates One is the baseline This is a reference scenario that the alternative mitigation scenario is compared with Others are the way costs are modelled and assumptions about future government policy46\u200a622\u200a Cost estimates for mitigation for specific regions depend on the quantity of emissions allowed for that region in future as well as the timing of interventions47\u200a90\nMitigation costs will vary according to how and when emissions are cut Early well-planned action will minimize the costs48 Globally the benefits of keeping warming under 2\u00a0C exceed the costs49\nEconomists estimate the cost of climate change mitigation at between 1 and 2 of GDP50 Whereas this is a large sum it is still far less than the subsidies governments provide to the ailing fossil fuel industry The International Monetary Fund estimated this at more than 5 trillion per year5152\nAnother estimate says that financial flows for climate mitigation and adaptation are going to be over 800 billion per year These financial requirements are predicted to exceed 4 trillion per year by 20305354\nGlobally limiting warming to 2\u00a0C may result in higher economic benefits than economic costs55\u200a300\u200a The economic repercussions of mitigation vary widely across regions and households depending on policy design and level of international cooperation Delayed global cooperation increases policy costs across regions especially in those that are relatively carbon intensive at present Pathways with uniform carbon values show higher mitigation costs in more carbon-intensive regions in fossil-fuels exporting regions and in poorer regions Aggregate quantifications expressed in GDP or monetary terms undervalue the economic effects on households in poorer countries The actual effects on welfare and well-being are comparatively larger56\nAdaptation costs are the costs of planning preparing for facilitating and implementing adaptation57\u200a31\u200a Adaptation benefits can be estimated in terms of reduced damages from the effects of climate change In economic terms the cost to benefit ratio of adaptation shows that each dollar can deliver large benefits For example it is estimated that every US1 billion invested in adaptation against coastal flooding leads to a US14 billion reduction in economic damages57\u200a52\u200a Investing in more resilient infrastructure in developing countries would provide an average of 4 in benefit for each 1 invested58 In other words a small percentage increase in investment costs can mitigate the potentially very large disruption to infrastructure costs\nA 2023 study found the overall adaptation costs for all developing countries to be around US215 billion per year for the period up to 2030 The highest adaptation expenses are for river flood protection infrastructure and coastal protection They also found that in most cases adaptation costs will be significantly higher by 205057\u200a3536\nIt is difficult to estimate both the costs of adaptation and the adaptation finance needs The costs of adaptation varies with the objective and the level of adaptation required and what is acceptable as residual ie unmanaged risk57\u200a33\u200a Similarly adaptation finance needs vary depending on the overall adaptation plans for the country city or region It also depends on the assessment methods used A 2023 study analysed country-level information submitted to the UNFCCC in National Adaptation Plans and Nationally Determined Contributions 85 countries It estimated global adaptation needs of developing countries annual average to be US387 billion for the period up to 203057\u200a31\nAccording to economic theory a carbon price should be set equal to the SCC In reality carbon tax and carbon emission trading only cover a limited number of countries and sectors which is vastly below the optimal SCC\nA carbon tax is a tax levied on the carbon emissions from producing goods and services Carbon taxes are intended to make visible the hidden social costs of carbon emissions They are designed to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by essentially increasing the price of fossil fuels This both decreases demand for goods and services that produce high emissions and incentivizes making them less carbon-intensive65 When a fossil fuel such as coal petroleum or natural gas is burned most or all of its carbon is converted to CO2 Greenhouse gas emissions cause climate change This negative externality can be reduced by taxing carbon content at any point in the product cycle66676869\nVarious economic tools are employed to understand the economic aspects around impacts of climate change climate change mitigation and adaptation Several sets of tools or approaches exist Econometric models statistical models are used to integrate the broad impacts of climate change with other economic drivers to quantify the economic costs and assess the value of climate-related policies often for a specific sector or region Structural economic models look at market and non-market impacts affecting the whole economy through its inputs and outputs Process models simulate physical chemical and biological processes under climate change and the economic effects4\u200a2495\nIntergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC has relied on process-based integrated assessment models to quantify mitigation scenarios7374 They have been used to explore different pathways for staying within climate policy targets such as the 15\u00a0C target agreed upon in the Paris Agreement75 Moreover these models have underpinned research including energy policy assessment76 and simulate the Shared socioeconomic pathways7778 Notable modelling frameworks include IMAGE79 MESSAGEix80 AIMGCE81 GCAM82 REMIND-MAgPIE8384 and WITCH-GLOBIOM8586 While these scenarios are highly policy-relevant interpretation of the scenarios should be done with care87\nComputable general equilibrium models\nComputable general equilibrium CGE models are a class of economic models that use actual economic data to estimate how an economy might react to changes in policy technology or other external factors CGE models are also referred to as AGE applied general equilibrium models A CGE model consists of equations describing model variables and a database usually very detailed consistent with these model equations The equations tend to be neoclassical in spirit often assuming cost-minimizing behaviour by producers average-cost pricing and household demands based on optimizing behaviour\nAggregate cost-benefit models\nIntegrated assessment models IAMs are also used make aggregate estimates of the costs of climate change These cost-benefit models balance the economic implications of mitigation and climate damages to identify the pathway of emissions reductions that will maximize total economic welfare91 In other words the trade-offs between climate change impacts adaptation and mitigation are made explicit The costs of each policy and the outcomes modelled are converted into monetary estimates\nThe models incorporate aspects of the natural social and economic sciences in a highly aggregated way Compared to other climate-economy models including process-based IAMs they do not have the structural detail necessary to model interactions with energy systems land-use etc and their economic implications91\nA more recent modelling approach uses empirical statistical methods to investigate how the economy is affected by weather variation4\u200a2495\u200a92\u200a755\u200a This approach can causatively identify effects of temperature rainfall and other climate variables on agriculture energy demand industry and other economic activity Panel data are used giving weather variation over time and spatial areas eg ground station observations or interpolated gridded data These are typically aggregated for economic analysis eg to investigate effects on national economies92 These studies examine temperature and rainfall and events such as droughts and windstorms They show that for example hot years are linked to lower income growth in poor countries and low rainfall is linked to reduced incomes in Africa92\u200a755\u200a Other econometric studies show that there are negative impacts of hotter temperatures on agricultural output and on labour productivity in factories call centres and in outdoor industries such as mining and forestry The analyses are used to estimate the costs of climate change in the future\nStandard costbenefit analysis CBA has been applied to the problem of climate change In a CBA framework the negative and positive impacts associated with a given action are converted into monetary estimates93 This is also referred to as a monetized costbenefit framework Various types of model can provide information for CBA including energy-economy-environment models process models that study energy systems and their transitions Some of these models may include a physical model of the climate Computable General Equilibrium CGE structural models investigate effects of policies including climate policies on economic growth trade employment and public revenues However most CBA analyses are produced using aggregate integrated assessment models These aggregate-type IAMs are particularly designed for doing CBA of climate change94\u200a428\u200a95\u200a238239\nThe CBA framework requires 1 the valuation of costs and benefits using willingness to pay WTP or willingness to accept WTA compensation96979899 as a measure of value100 and 2 a criterion for accepting or rejecting proposals100\nFor 1 in CBA where WTPWTA is used climate change impacts are aggregated into a monetary value96 with environmental impacts converted into consumption equivalents101 and risk accounted for using certainty equivalents101102 Values over time are then discounted to produce their equivalent present values103 The valuation of costs and benefits of climate change can be controversial2\u200a936938\u200a because some climate change impacts are difficult to assign a value to eg ecosystems and human health104105 It is also impossible to know the preferences of future generations which affects the valuation of costs and benefits106\u200a4\u200a Another difficulty is quantifying the risks of future climate change107\nFor 2 the standard criterion is the KaldorHicks106\u200a3\u200a compensation principle100 According to the compensation principle so long as those benefiting from a particular project compensate the losers and there is still something left over then the result is an unambiguous gain in welfare100 If there are no mechanisms allowing compensation to be paid then it is necessary to assign weights to particular individuals100 One of the mechanisms for compensation is impossible for this problem mitigation might benefit future generations at the expense of current generations but there is no way that future generations can compensate current generations for the costs of mitigation106\u200a4\u200a On the other hand should future generations bear most of the costs of climate change compensation to them would not be possible108 Another transfer for compensation exists between regions and populations If for example some countries were to benefit from reducing climate change but others lose out there would be no guarantee that the winners would compensate the losers108\nIn a CBA framework the distribution of benefits from adaptation and mitigation policies are different in terms of damages avoided109\u200a653\u200abetter\u00a0source\u00a0needed Adaptation activities mainly benefit those who implement them while mitigation benefits others who may not have made mitigation investments Mitigation can therefore be viewed as a global public good while adaptation is either a private good in the case of autonomous adaptation or a national or regional public good in the case of public sector policies\nThe optimal levels of mitigation and adaptation are resolved by comparing the marginal costs of action with the marginal benefits of avoided climate change damages109\u200a654\u200a A common finding of costbenefit analysis is that the optimum level of emissions reduction is modest in the near-term with more stringent abatement in the longer-term110\u200a298\u200a111\u200a20\u200a112better\u00a0source\u00a0needed \nThis approach might lead to a warming of more than 3\u00a0C above the pre-industrial level113\u200a8\u200abetter\u00a0source\u00a0needed\nCBA has several strengths it offers an internally consistent and global comprehensive analysis of impacts2\u200a955\u200a Furthermore sensitivity analysis allows critical assumptions in CBA analysis to be changed This can identify areas where the value of information is highest and where additional research might have the highest payoffs114\u200a119\u200a However there are many uncertainties that affect costbenefit analysis for example sector- and country-specific damage functions109\u200a654\nDamage functions play an important role in estimating the costs associated with potential damages caused by climate-related hazards They quantify the relationship between the intensity of the hazard other factors such as the vulnerability of the system and the resulting damages For example damage functions have been developed for sea level rise agricultural productivity or heat effects on labour productivity115 In a CBA framework damages are monetized to facilitate comparison with the benefits of proposed actions or policies Sensitivity analysis is conducted to assess the robustness of the results to changes in assumptions and parameters including those of the damage function\nSensitivity analysis allows assumptions to be changed in aggregate analysis to see what effect it has on results Smith et al 20019432\nCost-Effectiveness Analysis CEA is preferable to CBA when the benefits of impacts adaptation and mitigation are difficult to estimate in monetary terms A CEA can be used to compare different policy options for achieving a well-defined goal95\u200a238\u200a This goal ie the benefit is usually expressed as the amount of GHG emissions reduction in the analysis of mitigation measures For adaptation measures there is no single common goal or metric for the economic benefits Adaptation involves responding to different types of risks in different sectors and local contexts For example the goal might be the reduction of land area in hectares at risk to sea level rise116\u200a2\nCEA involves the costing of each option and providing a cost per unit of effectiveness For example cost per tonne of GHG reduced tCO2 This allows the ranking of policy options This ranking can help decision-maker to understand which are the most cost-effective options ie those that deliver high benefits for low costs CEA can be used for minimising net costs for achieving pre-defined policy targets such as meeting an emissions reduction target for a given sector95\u200a238\u200a116\u200a23\nCEA like CBA is a type of decision analysis method Many of these methods work well when different stakeholders work together on a problem to understand and manage risks117\u200a2543\u200a For example by discussing how well certain options might work in the real world Or by helping in measuring the costs and benefits as part of a CEA117\u200a2566\u200a2576\nSome authors have focused on a disaggregated analysis of climate change impacts118\u200a23\u200a119 Disaggregated refers to the choice to assess impacts in a variety of indicators or units eg changes in agricultural yields and loss of biodiversity By contrast monetized CBA converts all impacts into a common unit money which is used to assess changes in social welfare\nThe long time scales and uncertainty associated with global warming have led analysts to develop scenarios of future environmental social and economic changes121 These scenarios can help governments understand the potential consequences of their decisions\nThe projected temperature in climate change scenarios is subject to scientific uncertainty eg the relationship between concentrations of GHGs and global mean temperature which is called the climate sensitivity Projections of future atmospheric concentrations based on emission pathways are also affected by scientific uncertainties eg over how carbon sinks such as forests will be affected by future climate change\nOne of the economic aspects of climate change is producing scenarios of future economic development Future economic developments can for example affect how vulnerable society is to future climate change122  what the future impacts of climate change might be as well as the level of future GHG emissions123\nScenarios are neither predictions nor forecasts but are stories of possible futures that provide alternate outcomes relevant to a decision-maker or other user124\u200a2576\u200a These alternatives usually also include a baseline or reference scenario for comparison Business-as-usual scenarios have been developed in which there are no additional policies beyond those currently in place and socio-economic development is consistent with recent trends This term is now used less frequently than in the past125\nIn scenario analysis scenarios are developed that are based on differing assumptions of future development patterns121 An example of this are the shared socioeconomic pathways produced by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC These project a wide range of possible future emissions levels\nScenarios often support sector-specific analysis of the physical effects and economic costs of climate change Scenarios are used with costbenefit analysis or cost-effectiveness analysis of climate policies\nRisk management can be used to evaluate policy decisions based a range of criteria or viewpoints and is not restricted to the results of particular type of analysis eg monetized CBA126\u200a42\u200a Another approach is that of uncertainty analysis121 where analysts attempt to estimate the probability of future changes in emission levels\nIn a costbenefit analysis an acceptable risk means that the benefits of a climate policy outweigh the costs of the policy107 The standard rule used by public and private decision makers is that a risk will be acceptable if the expected net present value is positive107 The expected value is the mean of the distribution of expected outcomes127\u200a25\u200a In other words it is the average expected outcome for a particular decision This criterion has been justified on the basis that\nOn the second point it has been suggested that insurance could be bought against climate change risks107\nPolicymakers and investors are beginning to recognize the implications of climate change for the financial sector from both physical risks damage to property infrastructure and land and transition risk due to changes in policy technology and consumer and market behavior Financial institutions are becoming increasingly aware of the need to incorporate the economics of low carbon emissions into business models128\nIn the scientific literature there is sometimes a focus on best estimate or likely values of climate sensitivity129  However from a risk management perspective values outside of likely ranges are relevant because though these values are less probable they could be associated with more severe climate impacts130 the statistical definition of risk  probability of an impact  magnitude of the impact131\u200a208\nAnalysts have also looked at how uncertainty over climate sensitivity affects economic estimates of climate change impacts132  Policy guidance from cost-benefit analysis CBA can be extremely divergent depending on the assumptions employed133  Hassler et al use integrated assessment modeling to examine a range of estimates and what happens at  extremes134\nTwo related ways of thinking about the problem of climate change decision-making in the presence of uncertainty are iterative risk management135131\nand sequential decision making136\u200a612614\u200a\nConsiderations in a risk-based approach might include for example the potential for low-probability worst-case climate change impacts137One of the responses to the uncertainties of global warming is to adopt a strategy of sequential decision making138 Sequential decision making refers to the process in which the decision maker makes consecutive observations of the process before making a final decision139 This strategy recognizes that decisions on global warming need to be made with incomplete information and that decisions in the near term will have potentially long-term impacts Governments may use risk management as part of their policy response to global warming140131\u200a203\nAn approach based on sequential decision making recognizes that over time decisions related to climate change can be revised in the light of improved information138 This is particularly important with respect to climate change due to the long-term nature of the problem A near-term hedging strategy concerned with reducing future climate impacts might favor stringent near-term emissions reductions136 As stated earlier carbon dioxide accumulates in the atmosphere and to stabilize the atmospheric concentration of CO2 emissions would need to be drastically reduced from their present level\nStringent near-term emissions reductions allow for greater future flexibility with regard to a low stabilization target eg 450 parts per million ppm CO2 To put it differently stringent near-term emissions abatement can be seen as having an option value in allowing for lower long-term stabilization targets This option may be lost if near-term emissions abatement is less stringent141\nOn the other hand a view may be taken that points to the benefits of improved information over time This may suggest an approach where near-term emissions abatement is more modest142 Another way of viewing the problem is to look at the potential irreversibility of future climate change impacts eg damages to biomes and ecosystems against the irreversibility of making investments in efforts to reduce emissions138\nAn example of a framework that is based on risk management is portfolio analysis This approach is based on portfolio theory originally applied in the areas of finance and investment It has also been applied to the analysis of climate change143144 The idea is that a reasonable response to uncertainty is to invest in a wide portfolio of options More specifically the aim is to minimise the variance and co-variance of the performance of investments in the portfolio In the case of climate change mitigation performance is measured by how much GHG emissions reduction is achieved On the other hand climate change adaptation acts as insurance against the chance that unfavourable impacts occur145 The performance of adaptation options could either be defined in economic terms eg revenue or as physical metrics eg the quantity of water conserved143\nIt is important to compare alternative portfolios of options across different future climate change scenarios in order to take into account uncertainty in climate impacts GHG emission trends etc The options should ideally be diversified to be effective in different scenarios ie some options suited for a nolow climate change scenario with other options being suited for scenarios with severe climate changes144\nInvestment and financial flow IFF studies typically consider how much it might cost to increase the resilience of future investments or financial flows146 They also investigate the potential sources of investment funds and the types of financing entities or actors Aggregated studies assess the sensitivity of future investments estimating the risk from climate change and estimating the additional investment needed to increase resilience More detailed studies undertake investment and financial flow analysis at a sectoral level to provide detailed costing of the additional marginal costs needed for building resilience146\nThere are a number of benefits of using aggregated assessments to measure economic impacts of climate change2\u200a954\u200a They allow impacts to be directly compared between different regions and times Impacts can be compared with other environmental problems and also with the costs of avoiding those impacts A problem of aggregated analyses is that they often reduce different types of impacts into a small number of indicators It can be argued that some impacts are not well-suited to this eg the monetization of mortality and loss of species diversity On the other hand where there are monetary costs of avoiding impacts it may not be possible to avoid monetary valuation of those impacts147\u200a364\nNo consensus exists on who should bear the burden of adaptation and mitigation costs127\u200a29\u200a Several different arguments have been made over how to spread the costs and benefits of taxes or systems based on emissions trading\nOne approach considers the problem from the perspective of who benefits most from the public good This approach is sensitive to the fact that different preferences exist between different income classes The public good is viewed in a similar way as a private good where those who use the public good must pay for it Some people will benefit more from the public good than others thus creating inequalities in the absence of benefit taxes A difficulty with public goods is determining who exactly benefits from the public good although some estimates of the distribution of the costs and benefits of global warming have been made  see above Additionally this approach does not provide guidance as to how the surplus of benefits from climate policy should be shared\nA second approach has been suggested based on economics and the social welfare function To calculate the social welfare function requires an aggregation of the impacts of climate change policies and climate change itself across all affected individuals This calculation involves a number of complexities and controversial equity issues97\u200a460\u200a \nFor example the monetization of certain impacts on human health There is also controversy over the issue of benefits affecting one individual offsetting negative impacts on another2 \u200a958\u200a These issues to do with equity and aggregation cannot be fully resolved by economics148\u200a87\nOn a utilitarian basis which has traditionally been used in welfare economics an argument can be made for richer countries taking on most of the burdens of mitigation149 However another result is possible with a different modeling of impacts If an approach is taken where the interests of poorer people have lower weighting the result is that there is a much weaker argument in favour of mitigation action in rich countries Valuing climate change impacts in poorer countries less than domestic climate change impacts both in terms of policy and the impacts of climate change would be consistent with observed spending in rich countries on foreign aid150151\u200a229\nA third approach looks at the problem from the perspective of who has contributed most to the problem Because the industrialized countries have contributed more than two-thirds of the stock of human-induced GHGs in the atmosphere this approach suggests that they should bear the largest share of the costs This stock of emissions has been described as an environmental debt152\u200a167\u200a \nIn terms of efficiency this view is not supported This is because efficiency requires incentives to be forward-looking and not retrospective127\u200a29\u200a The question of historical responsibility is a matter of ethics It has been suggested that developed countries could address the issue by making side-payments to developing countries152\u200a167\nA 2019 modelling study found climate change had contributed towards global economic inequality Wealthy countries in colder regions had either felt little overall economic impact from climate change or possibly benefited whereas poor hotter countries very likely grew less than if global warming had not occurred153 Part of this observation stems from the fact that greenhouse gas emissions come mainly from high-income countries while low-income countries are affected by it negatively154 So high-income countries are producing significant amounts of emissions but the impacts are unequally threatening low-income countries who do not have access to the resources to recover from such impacts This further deepens the inequalities within the poor and the rich hindering sustainability efforts Impacts of climate change could even push millions of people into poverty155\nTraditional insurance works by transferring risk to those better able or more willing to bear risk and also by the pooling of risk127\u200a25\u200a Since the risks of climate change are to some extent correlated this reduces the effectiveness of pooling However there is reason to believe that different regions will be affected differently by climate change This suggests that pooling might be effective Since developing countries appear to be potentially most at risk from the effects of climate change developed countries could provide insurance against these risks156\nDisease rising seas reduced crop yields and other harms driven by climate change will likely have a major deleterious impact on the economy by 2050 unless the world sharply reduces greenhouse gas emissions in the near term according to a number of studies including a study by the Carbon Disclosure Project and a study by insurance giant Swiss Re The Swiss Re assessment found that annual output by the world economy will be reduced by 23\u00a0trillion annually unless greenhouse gas emissions are adequately mitigated As a consequence according to the Swiss Re study climate change will impact how the insurance industry prices a variety of risks157158159\nAuthors have pointed to several reasons why commercial insurance markets cannot adequately cover risks associated with climate change160\u200a72\u200a For example there is no international market where individuals or countries can insure themselves against losses from climate change or related climate change policiesclarification needed\nFinancial markets for risk\nThere are several options for how insurance could be used in responding to climate change160\u200a72\u200a One response could be to have binding agreements between countries Countries suffering greater-than-average climate-related losses would be assisted by those suffering less-than-average losses This would be a type of mutual insurance contract\nThese two approaches would allow for a more efficient distribution of climate change risks They would also allow for different beliefs over future climate outcomes For example it has been suggested that these markets might provide an objective test of the honesty of a particular countrys beliefs over climate change Countrieswhich that honestly believe that climate change presents little riskclarification needed would be more prone to hold securities against these risks\nStudies in 2019 suggest that economic damages due to climate change have been underestimated and may be severe with the probability of disastrous tail-risk events161162\nTipping points are critical thresholds that when crossed lead to large accelerating and often irreversible changes in the climate system The science of tipping points is complex and there is great uncertainty as to how they might unfold163 Economic analyses often exclude the potential effect of tipping points A 2018 study noted that the global economic impact is underestimated by a factor of two to eight when tipping points are excluded from consideration25\nThe Stern Review from 2006 for the British Government predicted that world GDP would be reduced by several percent due to climate related costs However their calculations may omit ecological effects that are difficult to quantify economically such as human deaths or loss of biodiversity or whose economic consequences will manifest slowly164 Therefore their calculations may be an underestimate The study has received both criticism and support from other economists see Stern Review for more information\nSome have said that economic growth is a key driver of CO2 emissions167\u200a707\u200abetter\u00a0source\u00a0needed168contradictory169170 However later in late 2022 others have said that economic growth no longer means higher emissions171 As the economy expands demand for energy and energy-intensive goods increases pushing up CO2 emissions On the other hand economic growth may drive technological change and increase energy efficiency Economic growth may be associated with specialization in certain economic sectors If specialization is in energy-intensive sectors specifically carbon energy sources then there will be a strong link between economic growth and emissions growth If specialization is in less energy-intensive sectors eg the services sector then there might be a weak link between economic growth and emissions growth A recent study found that in general there is some degree of flexibility between economic growth and emissions growth172\nScientists report that degrowth scenarios where economic output either declines or declines in terms of contemporary economic metrics such as current GDP have been neglected in considerations of 15\u2009C scenarios reported by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change IPCC They find that investigated degrowth scenarios minimize many key risks for feasibility and sustainability compared to technology-driven pathways with a core problem of such being feasibility in the context of contemporary decision-making of politics and globalized rebound- and relocation-effects173174 This is supported by other studies which state that absolute decoupling is highly unlikely to be achieved fast enough to prevent global warming over 15 C or 2 C even under optimistic policy conditions175",
